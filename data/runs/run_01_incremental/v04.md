# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Set clear rules for creating secure passwords and enable secure single sign-on for easier access. Keep our organization's information safe and reduce the number of passwords users need to remember.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems that require a password, including all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems. Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. Change passwords every three months. Store passwords securely. Keep track of previous passwords to avoid reusing the last five. Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems. Require biometric verification for high-security access. Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to only those who are authorized. Use a Zero Trust approach to security.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for making access decisions. Use a secure server for administrative tasks. Separate networks based on sensitivity. Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive information throughout its lifecycle. Ensure we meet compliance standards.

### Scope
Includes all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Protect stored data with strong encryption. Secure data in transit with the latest encryption methods. Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates. Follow data handling rules set by GDPR.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have less strict encryption. Never use production data in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a quick response plan for security incidents. Reduce damage by analyzing the situation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Use a centralized logging system for monitoring. Maintain systems to detect threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use a separate environment for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. Every incident must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the safety of data stored in cloud services. Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Scope
Covers all data stored in cloud services and all personnel with access to cloud storage.

### Directives
Encrypt data both when stored and when being transferred. Use strict access controls to limit who can access data. Regularly review and update access permissions. Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA. Conduct regular security checks of cloud service providers.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud access logs monthly. Report any non-compliance to the CISO.
