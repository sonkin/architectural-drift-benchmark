# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Set clear rules for creating secure passwords and enable secure single sign-on for easier access. Keep our organization's information safe and reduce the number of passwords users need to remember.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems that require a password, including all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a smartphone app or hardware token), or something they are (biometric verification).
   
2. **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** To create a strong password, users should think of a phrase or a combination of unrelated words and then modify it by adding numbers and symbols, ensuring it meets the complexity requirements.

3. **Change passwords every three months.** Users will receive reminders via email to update their passwords, and they should follow the established guidelines for creating a new password that meets the security criteria.

4. **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a password manager to store and manage passwords, ensuring that the master password for the manager is also strong and unique.

5. **Keep track of previous passwords to avoid reusing the last five.** Users should maintain a log of their previous passwords in a secure manner, ensuring that they do not revert to any of the last five passwords used.

6. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** When implementing authentication for applications, developers should integrate OIDC for new applications and ensure that legacy systems are compatible with SAML for seamless user access.

7. **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** For systems that handle sensitive information, implement biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint scanning or facial recognition to enhance security.

8. **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, with defined response times for any outages.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to only those who are authorized. Use a Zero Trust approach to security.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for making access decisions.** Assign permissions based on the roles of users within the organization, ensuring that individuals only have access to the resources necessary for their job functions.

2. **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure that administrative tasks are performed on a dedicated, secure server that is isolated from the general network to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible through secure channels and to authorized personnel.

4. **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor and analyze endpoint activity, allowing for the identification of potential security threats in real-time.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive information throughout its lifecycle. Ensure we meet compliance standards.

### Scope
Includes all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Protect stored data with strong encryption.** Utilize industry-standard encryption algorithms to secure data at rest, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access or read the data without the appropriate decryption keys.

2. **Secure data in transit with the latest encryption methods.** Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other secure protocols to encrypt data being transmitted over networks, protecting it from interception during transfer.

3. **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Establish a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization.

4. **Follow data handling rules set by GDPR.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by implementing necessary policies and procedures for data collection, storage, and sharing.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have less strict encryption. Never use production data in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a quick response plan for security incidents. Reduce damage by analyzing the situation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Use a centralized logging system for monitoring.** Implement a centralized logging solution that aggregates logs from various systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events.

2. **Maintain systems to detect threats.** Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to continuously monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.

3. **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that only personnel with a legitimate need to know have access to sensitive information during incident investigations, minimizing the risk of further exposure.

4. **Use a separate environment for forensic analysis.** Conduct forensic investigations in a controlled, isolated environment to prevent contamination of evidence and ensure the integrity of the analysis.

### Exceptions
None. Every incident must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the safety of data stored in cloud services. Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Scope
Covers all data stored in cloud services and all personnel with access to cloud storage.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data both when stored and when being transferred.** Implement encryption protocols for data at rest in cloud storage and during transmission to ensure that sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access.

2. **Use strict access controls to limit who can access data.** Establish and enforce access control policies that define who can access specific data sets, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions.

3. **Regularly review and update access permissions.** Conduct periodic reviews of user access rights to ensure that permissions are current and appropriate, revoking access for users who no longer require it.

4. **Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA.** Regularly assess cloud storage practices to ensure they align with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, implementing necessary changes to maintain compliance.

5. **Conduct regular security checks of cloud service providers.** Perform due diligence on cloud service providers by reviewing their security practices, certifications, and compliance with industry standards to ensure they meet organizational security requirements.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud access logs monthly. Report any non-compliance to the CISO.
