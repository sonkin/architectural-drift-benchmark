# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Department

### Purpose
Develop a proactive incident response plan that minimizes damage and enhances our organization's resilience. By effectively analyzing and addressing security incidents, we not only protect our assets but also reinforce stakeholder confidence and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
- **Use a centralized logging system for monitoring.** Implement a centralized logging solution that aggregates logs from various systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events.

- **Maintain systems to detect threats.** Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to continuously monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.

- **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that only personnel with a legitimate need to know have access to sensitive information during incident investigations, minimizing the risk of further exposure.

- **Use a separate environment for forensic analysis.** Conduct forensic investigations in a controlled, isolated environment to prevent contamination of evidence and ensure the integrity of the analysis.

- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a smartphone app or hardware token), or something they are (biometric verification).

- **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** To create a strong password, users should think of a phrase or a combination of unrelated words and then modify it by adding numbers and symbols, ensuring it meets the complexity requirements.

- **Change passwords every three months.** Users will receive reminders via email to update their passwords, and they should follow the established guidelines for creating a new password that meets the security criteria.

- **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a password manager to store and manage passwords, ensuring that the master password for the manager is also strong and unique.

- **Keep track of previous passwords to avoid reusing the last five.** Users should maintain a log of their previous passwords in a secure manner, ensuring that they do not revert to any of the last five passwords used.

- **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** When implementing authentication for applications, developers should integrate OIDC for new applications and ensure that legacy systems are compatible with SAML for seamless user access.

- **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** For systems that handle sensitive information, implement biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint scanning or facial recognition to enhance security.

- **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, with defined response times for any outages.

### Exceptions
None. Every incident must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned. Any violation of this policy will result in a penalty of $500 for the first offense, escalating to $1,000 for the second offense within a 12-month period. A third violation will result in a mandatory review meeting with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and may lead to further disciplinary action, including potential termination of employment. All violations will be documented, and a follow-up review will occur within 30 days to ensure compliance with the policy.

### Directives
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a smartphone app or hardware token), or something they are (biometric verification).

- **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** To create a strong password, users should think of a phrase or a combination of unrelated words and then modify it by adding numbers and symbols, ensuring it meets the complexity requirements.

- **Change passwords every three months.** Users will receive reminders via email to update their passwords, and they should follow the established guidelines for creating a new password that meets the security criteria.

- **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a password manager to store and manage passwords, ensuring that the master password for the manager is also strong and unique.

- **Keep track of previous passwords to avoid reusing the last five.** Users should maintain a log of their previous passwords in a secure manner, ensuring that they do not revert to any of the last five passwords used.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. The first violation will incur a penalty of $250, with a second violation resulting in a $500 penalty. A third violation will necessitate a meeting with HR and may lead to suspension or termination, depending on the severity of the breach. All violations will be reviewed within 14 days, and a follow-up will be conducted to ensure compliance with the policy.
