# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Department

### Purpose
Develop a proactive incident response plan that minimizes damage and enhances our organization's resilience. By effectively analyzing and addressing security incidents, we not only protect our assets but also reinforce stakeholder confidence and maintain business continuity. Remember, adopting a Zero Trust model is essential to ensure that no user or system is automatically trusted, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is crucial for securing access to important systems.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
A centralized logging system for monitoring must be used. This involves implementing a centralized logging solution that aggregates logs from various systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events. Additionally, systems must be maintained to detect threats by deploying intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to continuously monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.

During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege should be followed, ensuring that only personnel with a legitimate need to know have access to sensitive information, thereby minimizing the risk of further exposure. Forensic analysis must be conducted in a separate environment to prevent contamination of evidence and ensure the integrity of the analysis.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for important systems, which involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system. This may include something they know (a password), something they have (a smartphone app or hardware token), or something they are (biometric verification). Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. To create a strong password, users should think of a phrase or a combination of unrelated words and then modify it by adding numbers and symbols, ensuring it meets the complexity requirements. Passwords must be changed every three months, with users receiving reminders via email to update their passwords, following the established guidelines for creating a new password that meets the security criteria.

Passwords should be stored securely by utilizing a password manager to store and manage passwords, ensuring that the master password for the manager is also strong and unique. Users must keep track of previous passwords to avoid reusing the last five, maintaining a log of their previous passwords in a secure manner. When implementing authentication for applications, developers should use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems to ensure seamless user access. For systems that handle sensitive information, biometric verification is required, implementing methods such as fingerprint scanning or facial recognition to enhance security. Service level agreements (SLA) must be set for identity provider uptime, establishing clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, with defined response times for any outages.

### Exceptions
None. Every incident must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents and document lessons learned. Any violation of this policy will result in a penalty of $500 for the first offense, escalating to $1,000 for the second offense within a 12-month period. A third violation will result in a mandatory review meeting with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and may lead to further disciplinary action, including potential termination of employment. All violations will be documented, and a follow-up review will occur within 30 days to ensure compliance with the policy.
