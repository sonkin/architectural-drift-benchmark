# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect our assets and enhance operational efficiency.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track password history for the last five passwords. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.
