# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish strong authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance security. This approach reduces risks and improves trust.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters. Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track password history for the last five changes. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. This ensures security and protects sensitive information.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a swift response to security incidents. This minimizes damage and protects our reputation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.
