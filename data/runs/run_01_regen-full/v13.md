# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects valuable assets. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly. Historical passwords must not be reused within the last five cycles. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. For high-security access, require Biometric verification.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team may incur penalties of up to $500. Repeated violations may result in access revocation within 30 days.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access protects sensitive information and enhances security. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures only authorized personnel access critical resources.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access may trigger investigations, with penalties of up to $1,000 for violations.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. Strong data protection enhances business reputation and reduces liability.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be present in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance. Non-compliance may escalate to the CISO, with penalties of up to $2,000 for violations.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
A rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects organizational assets. Effective incident management enhances resilience and operational continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats proactively. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Failure to comply may incur penalties of up to $1,500, with escalation within 14 days.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and enhances operational efficiency. Strong security measures improve compliance and reduce risks associated with data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using industry-standard encryption methods. Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance may result in penalties of up to $1,000, with escalation within 30 days.

## 6. Identity Federation

### Purpose
Enabling secure single sign-on capabilities reduces password fatigue and enhances user experience. Streamlined access improves productivity and security.

### Scope
This policy applies to all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
Implement OIDC for modern applications and support SAML for legacy systems. Define SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Federation logs will be monitored regularly. Anomalies may trigger alerts, with penalties of up to $500 for violations.
