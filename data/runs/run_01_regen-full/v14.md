# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets and enhance operational efficiency. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include complexity requirements. Rotate passwords quarterly and track historical passwords. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team may incur penalties of $500 for first offenses. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation within 30 days. See Section 2 for additional enforcement details.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and operational efficiency through a Zero Trust architecture.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access may result in penalties of $1,000 and trigger an investigation within 48 hours.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements and enhancing customer trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols. Implement PKI for certificate management and adhere to GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance may incur penalties of $2,000 and escalate to the CISO within 14 days.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage and ensuring business continuity through effective Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging and monitoring. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to protect sensitive data.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Non-compliance may incur penalties of $3,000 and require documentation of lessons learned within 30 days.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure cloud storage practices to protect sensitive data and enhance operational efficiency while maintaining compliance with industry standards.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using strong encryption methods. Implement access controls based on RBAC principles. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, documented, and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance may incur penalties of $1,500 and require corrective actions within 30 days. Regular audits will ensure adherence to this policy.
