# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances our business's integrity and trust. It protects our assets and ensures operational efficiency, leading to better ROI.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. It covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly. Historical passwords must not be reused within the last five cycles. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access to authorized personnel enhances security and reduces risks. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture ensures that only verified users can access sensitive data.

### Scope
This policy applies to all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. For example, if a critical system fails, temporary access may be necessary. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle is crucial for maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance. This ensures our business operates efficiently and securely.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to safeguard data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments. Document any exceptions and review them quarterly.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establishing a rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our assets. Using Kill Chain analysis helps us understand and mitigate threats effectively.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented to improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage is vital for protecting sensitive data and ensuring business continuity. It enhances our operational efficiency and compliance with regulations.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects requiring relaxed security measures. Document these exceptions and review them quarterly to ensure they remain justified.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO for further action.
