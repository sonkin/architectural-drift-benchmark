## 1. Password Policy

### Purpose
This policy defines secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets.

### Scope
It applies to all employees and contractors using systems that require authentication.

### Directives
- Use MFA for all critical systems.
- Minimum password length is 12 characters.
- Passwords must include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Rotate passwords quarterly.
- Track historical passwords to prevent reuse.
- Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section restricts network access to authorized personnel and implements Zero Trust architecture.

### Scope
It covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices.

### Directives
- Implement RBAC for all access decisions.
- Use a Bastion Host for administrative access.
- Segment networks based on sensitivity.
- Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
