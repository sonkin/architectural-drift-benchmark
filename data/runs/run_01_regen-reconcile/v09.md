# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our valuable assets. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves overall security posture.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Implement RBAC for access control. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Store passwords using Cryptographic Salt. Rotate passwords quarterly. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Track password history to prevent reuse.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and reducing risks. Implementing Zero Trust architecture strengthens our defenses.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance and safeguarding our reputation. Strong data protection enhances customer trust and loyalty.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits conducted. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage and protecting our assets. Effective incident response enhances our resilience and reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned for future improvement.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure cloud storage practices to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance. Strong cloud security enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest and Data In Transit in cloud storage. Implement access controls using RBAC. Ensure compliance with SOC2 and GDPR requirements.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage practices. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO.
