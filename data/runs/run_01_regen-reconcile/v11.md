# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our valuable assets. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves overall security posture, driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. It covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track password history for the last five passwords. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access to authorized personnel enhances security and protects sensitive information. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures only verified users can access resources.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. It applies to all personnel accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.
