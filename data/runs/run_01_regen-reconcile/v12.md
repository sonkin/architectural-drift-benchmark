# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets and enhance operational efficiency. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves user experience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and a history of the last five passwords must be tracked. Store all credentials using Cryptographic Salt to prevent unauthorized access. For high-security access, require Biometric verification to ensure identity.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and operational integrity. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures that only verified users can access sensitive resources.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure users have the least privilege necessary. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity to minimize risk. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to maintain trust and compliance. Ensuring data security enhances our reputation and operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to safeguard stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management and follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance with regulations.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage and maintain business continuity. Effective incident response enhances organizational resilience and trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to facilitate monitoring and analysis. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats proactively. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access to necessary personnel. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to capture lessons learned. Documentation of these reviews will be maintained for future reference.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect organizational assets and maintain compliance. Secure cloud storage enhances operational efficiency and trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR, must be maintained to protect sensitive information.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but they must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be reported to the appropriate authorities for action.
