# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance user experience. Strong authentication increases trust and reduces security risks.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication. Covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly and track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; these must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team may incur penalties of $500 for first offenses. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation within 30 days.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and operational efficiency. Implementing Zero Trust architecture minimizes risks and protects sensitive data.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. Applies to all personnel accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for additional details.

### Enforcement
Access logs are reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access incurs a $1,000 fine and triggers an immediate investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance and protecting our reputation. Effective data protection enhances customer trust and business value.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. Covers all data storage and transmission methods.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols. Implement PKI for certificate management and follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. Production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance. Non-compliance may result in penalties of $2,000, escalating to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage and ensuring business continuity. Effective incident response protects our assets and enhances resilience.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in the response process. Applies to all departments.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Failure to comply incurs a $1,500 fine, with lessons learned documented within 14 days.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure cloud storage practices to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance. Effective cloud security enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization. Covers all data stored in the cloud.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using industry-standard encryption methods. Implement strict access controls based on RBAC principles. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance may result in penalties of $1,000, with escalation to the CISO for serious breaches. Compliance reviews occur quarterly.
