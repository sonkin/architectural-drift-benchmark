# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our assets. Strong authentication methods improve operational efficiency and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be rotated quarterly, and history tracking requires the last five passwords to be unique. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation within 30 days.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. This approach minimizes risks and enhances our security posture.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. This approach safeguards our reputation and enhances business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO within 14 days.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
A rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our assets. Effective incident management enhances our resilience and operational continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented within 7 days of the incident.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and ensures compliance. This approach enhances our operational efficiency and mitigates risks associated with data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256. Implement access controls based on RBAC principles. Ensure compliance with GDPR and SOC2 requirements for data handling.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored through quarterly audits. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO within 14 days.
