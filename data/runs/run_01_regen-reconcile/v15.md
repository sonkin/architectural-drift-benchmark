# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets. Strong authentication enhances security and builds trust with clients and partners.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems requiring authentication, including cloud services and on-premises applications.

### Directives
Implement MFA for all critical systems. Ensure passwords have a minimum length of 12 characters. Require at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. Rotate passwords quarterly and track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt for added security.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document these exceptions and review them monthly. For example, if a legacy system cannot support MFA, it must be documented.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Penalties may include access revocation after three violations within six months. Escalation to management occurs after the second violation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing Zero Trust architecture enhances security and reduces risks associated with unauthorized access.

### Scope
This policy applies to all network infrastructure and all connected devices. It includes both internal and external access points.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. For instance, if immediate access is needed during a system failure, document the access granted. See Section 1 for further details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include suspension of access for 30 days.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements enhances trust and mitigates risks associated with data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. It includes data stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure communications. Implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure connections. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments. For example, if testing a new application, use dummy data.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO. Penalties may include mandatory training or access restrictions for 60 days.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents. A swift response minimizes damage and protects organizational reputation, ensuring business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in incident response. It includes both technical and non-technical staff.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to protect sensitive data.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response. For example, even minor incidents must be logged and reviewed.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory for all incidents. Lessons learned must be documented and shared. Penalties for non-compliance may include additional training or disciplinary action.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud. Protecting cloud data enhances business resilience and builds customer confidence in our services.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization. It includes both public and private cloud environments.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256 encryption. Implement access controls based on RBAC to restrict data access. Ensure compliance with GDPR and other relevant regulations to protect sensitive information.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. For instance, if a project requires immediate access to unencrypted data, document the request and approval. Review annually.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will assess compliance with cloud security measures. Non-compliance may result in penalties, including suspension of cloud access for 30 days. Escalation to management occurs after two violations.
