# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards. Protect organizational assets and reduce risks.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems requiring user authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters. Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords every three months. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel. Implement Zero Trust architecture for enhanced security.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Use RBAC for all access decisions. Employ a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with a post-incident review. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a quick response to security incidents. Minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud. Protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud. Use strong access controls to limit who can view or edit data. Regularly review cloud service provider compliance with industry standards.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to security protocols.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage security. Non-compliance reported to the CISO.
