# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish strong authentication standards to protect our assets and enhance security. This approach reduces risks and increases trust in our systems.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication.

### Directives
1. **Use MFA**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all critical systems. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length: 12 characters.
   - Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Track historical passwords to prevent reuse within the last five cycles.
3. **Password Rotation**: Change passwords every three months to maintain security.
4. **Credential Storage**: Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.
5. **Biometric Verification**: For high-security access, require biometric verification to enhance security.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document these exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. This approach enhances security and protects sensitive information.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Implement RBAC**: Use Role-Based Access Control for all access decisions. This ensures users only access what they need.
2. **Bastion Host**: Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to secure sensitive areas of the network.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity to minimize risk exposure.
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. This ensures compliance and builds customer trust.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission.
2. **PKI Implementation**: Use Public Key Infrastructure for managing digital certificates.
3. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow GDPR guidelines for handling personal data to ensure legal compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a swift response plan for security incidents. This minimizes damage and protects our reputation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
1. **SIEM Deployment**: Use a Security Information and Event Management system for centralized logging of security events.
2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats.
3. **Follow Least Privilege**: During investigations, ensure that personnel have only the access necessary to perform their tasks.
4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory post-incident reviews. Document lessons learned for future reference.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud. This protects our information and enhances operational efficiency.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all data stored in the cloud to protect against unauthorized access.
2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access cloud data.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure all cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to these security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage practices will be conducted. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly.
