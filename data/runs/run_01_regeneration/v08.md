# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security and protect our assets. By implementing strong authentication methods, we can reduce risks and improve our overall security posture.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA.
   - Users must provide at least two forms of verification.
   
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords must be changed every three months.
   - Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.
   - Store all passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - For high-security access, implement Biometric verification methods.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Define SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure availability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to ensure that only authorized personnel can access our network. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we can enhance security and protect sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure users have the minimum necessary access.
   
2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems.
   
3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on sensitivity to limit exposure.
   
4. **Monitoring**: 
   - Continuously monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Protecting our data ensures compliance with regulations and builds trust with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.
   
2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates and ensuring secure communications.
   
3. **Compliance**: 
   - Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. Quick action minimizes damage and protects our organization’s reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging and monitoring of security events.
   
2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats.
   
3. **Investigative Procedures**: 
   - Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access.
   
4. **Forensic Analysis**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned to improve future responses.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure our cloud storage solutions. Protecting our data in the cloud enhances our operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using industry-standard encryption methods.
   
2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access cloud data.
   
3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure all cloud storage practices comply with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.
