# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security and protect our organizational assets. By implementing strong authentication methods, we can reduce risks and improve overall security posture.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA. 
   - Users should provide at least two forms of verification, such as a password and a mobile authentication app.

2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters. 
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords should be changed every three months.
   - Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - For high-security access, biometric methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition must be used.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Ensure that identity provider uptime meets defined SLA standards to maintain access reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on restricting network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture will enhance our security framework.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Access decisions must be based on user roles. 
   - Regularly review roles to ensure they align with current job functions.

2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for all administrative access to critical systems. 
   - Ensure that only authorized personnel can access this host.

3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on data sensitivity to limit exposure. 
   - Regularly assess segmentation effectiveness.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: 
   - Monitor all devices connected to the network using Endpoint Telemetry. 
   - Analyze telemetry data for unusual activity.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements will enhance our reputation and trust with clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. 
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates. 
   - Regularly review and update certificates to maintain security.

3. **GDPR Compliance**: 
   - Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data. 
   - Conduct regular training on GDPR compliance for all employees.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective response, we can protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. 
   - Regularly analyze logs for potential threats.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. 
   - Use findings to improve security measures.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: 
   - Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. 
   - Limit access to only those who need it for their role.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence. 
   - Ensure that forensic procedures are documented.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned for future reference.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions. Protecting data in the cloud enhances our operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using industry-standard encryption methods. 
   - Regularly review encryption protocols to ensure they meet current standards.

2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement strict access controls for cloud storage. 
   - Use RBAC to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure that all cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR. 
   - Conduct regular compliance audits.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.

## Glossary

- **Zero Trust**: A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: A security process that requires two or more verification methods to gain access to a resource.
