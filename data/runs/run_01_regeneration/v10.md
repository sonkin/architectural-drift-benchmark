# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security through robust authentication methods. By implementing strong authentication, we protect our assets and improve overall business resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA. 
   - Users must provide at least two forms of verification, such as a password and a mobile authentication app.

2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Users must change passwords every three months.
   - Historical password tracking will prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - For high-security access, biometric methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition must be used.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Ensure the identity provider maintains an uptime of 99.9% to guarantee access.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication methods. Document these exceptions and review them annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation to management after three violations within six months.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on securing network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture ensures that every access request is verified, enhancing our security posture.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Access decisions must be based on user roles. 
   - Regularly review roles to ensure they align with current job functions.

2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for all administrative access to critical systems. 
   - Ensure that only authorized personnel can access this host.

3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on data sensitivity to limit exposure. 
   - Regularly assess segmentation effectiveness.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: 
   - Monitor all devices connected to the network using Endpoint Telemetry. 
   - Analyze telemetry data for unusual activity.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted but must undergo a post-incident review. See Section 1 for further details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an immediate investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to senior management after two incidents.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Protecting data not only ensures compliance with regulations like SOC2 but also builds trust with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. 
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates. 
   - Regularly review and update certificates to maintain security.

3. **GDPR Compliance**: 
   - Follow GDPR guidelines for data handling and processing. 
   - Conduct regular training for employees on GDPR requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $2,000, with escalation to the executive team after one incident.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective incident management, we protect our business interests and maintain operational integrity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. 
   - Regularly analyze logs for potential threats.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. 
   - Use findings to improve overall security measures.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: 
   - Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. 
   - Limit access to only those who need it for incident resolution.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence. 
   - Ensure that forensic procedures are documented and followed.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory for all security events. Lessons learned must be documented and shared with relevant stakeholders. Penalties for failure to comply with incident response procedures may include fines of up to $1,500, with escalation to the security team after one incident.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and enhance our operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256 encryption. 
   - Ensure encryption keys are managed securely.

2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement strict access controls to cloud storage. 
   - Use RBAC to limit access based on user roles.

3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure all cloud storage practices comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR. 
   - Conduct regular audits to verify compliance.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will assess compliance with cloud storage security measures. Non-compliance may result in fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to the IT department after two incidents.
