# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security through robust authentication methods. By implementing strong authentication, we protect our assets and improve overall business resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA. 
   - Users must provide at least two forms of verification, such as a password and a mobile authentication app.

2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters. 
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
   - Users must change passwords every three months. 
   - Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - For high-security access, biometric methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition must be implemented.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Define SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure availability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. See Section 2 for related access control exceptions.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation to management after three incidents within six months.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on restricting network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture enhances our security posture and protects sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Access decisions must be based on user roles. 
   - Regularly review roles to ensure they align with current job functions.

2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for all administrative access to critical systems. 
   - Ensure that only authorized personnel can access this host.

3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on data sensitivity. 
   - Implement firewalls to control traffic between segments.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: 
   - Monitor all devices connected to the network using Endpoint Telemetry. 
   - Analyze logs for unusual activity.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. Document all emergency access instances. See Section 1 for related authentication exceptions.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to the security team after two incidents.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring data security, we comply with SOC2 requirements and enhance customer trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. 
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure communications.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates. 
   - Regularly update and audit certificates to maintain security.

3. **GDPR Compliance**: 
   - Follow GDPR data handling requirements for all personal data. 
   - Ensure that data processing agreements are in place with third parties.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $2,000, with escalation to legal after one incident.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. 
   - Regularly review logs for anomalies.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. 
   - Use findings to improve security measures.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: 
   - Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. 
   - Limit access to only those who need it for their role.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis of compromised systems. 
   - Ensure that forensic data is stored securely.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented and shared. Penalties for failure to comply may include fines of up to $1,500, with escalation to the security team after one incident.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and enhance operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256 encryption. 
   - Ensure that encryption keys are managed securely.

2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement RBAC for cloud storage access. 
   - Regularly review access permissions to ensure they are appropriate.

3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure that cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR. 
   - Conduct regular audits of cloud service providers.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance may result in fines of up to $2,500, with escalation to the CISO after one incident.
