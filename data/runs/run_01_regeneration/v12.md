# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.

For modern applications, we will implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) to facilitate secure single sign-on capabilities. Legacy systems will support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for authentication. High-security access will require Biometric verification to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Additionally, we will define a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the uptime of our identity provider to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly to ensure compliance with security standards.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties assessed based on the severity of the breach. The escalation timeline for addressing violations will be within 48 hours of detection.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
We will implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions, ensuring that users have the minimum necessary access to perform their job functions. Administrative access will be managed through a Bastion Host, which serves as a secure gateway. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels to limit exposure. Continuous monitoring will be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect and respond to potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review will be required to assess the situation. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to ensure compliance. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties determined based on the nature of the breach.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Sensitive data must be encrypted when stored (Data At Rest) using AES-256 encryption standards. Additionally, data must be encrypted during transmission (Data In Transit) using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. We will implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing digital certificates, ensuring secure communications. Compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data handling requirements is mandatory to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. By preparing for incidents, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system will be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege will be followed to limit access to necessary personnel only. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to ensure that compromised systems are isolated from the network.

### Exceptions
No exceptions will be made; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned must be documented. Penalties for non-compliance with incident response procedures will be assessed based on the severity of the incident, with escalation timelines set at 72 hours for reporting findings.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring that sensitive data is protected while leveraging the benefits of cloud technology. By implementing strong security measures, we enhance our operational efficiency and protect our assets.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage solutions must adhere to the established security protocols.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will result in penalties, with escalation timelines set at 48 hours for addressing compliance issues.
