# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication methods, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be implemented to prevent reuse. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. We will implement OIDC for modern applications and support SAML for legacy systems. Additionally, we will define an SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which should also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties for non-compliance will be determined based on the severity of the violation, with escalation timelines established for each case.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on restricting network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our security framework.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
To control access, we will implement RBAC for all access decisions. Administrative access will be managed through a Bastion Host, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and we will monitor all activities using Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
In emergencies, access may be granted with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to identify any unauthorized access attempts. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties applied based on the nature of the breach.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Sensitive data must be encrypted using AES-256 when Data At Rest and TLS 1.3 when Data In Transit. We will implement PKI for certificate management and adhere to GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance and protect user privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. A swift response not only protects our assets but also enhances our reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
We will deploy a SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained for threat detection, and investigations will follow the principle of Least Privilege. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned will be documented to improve future responses. Penalties for non-compliance will be determined based on the severity of the incident, with specific escalation timelines established.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and compliance. By protecting our cloud assets, we enhance operational efficiency and reduce risks associated with data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions utilized by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular compliance checks will be conducted to ensure adherence to relevant regulations.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Compliance with this policy will be monitored through regular audits. Non-compliance will result in penalties, with escalation timelines based on the severity of the breach.
