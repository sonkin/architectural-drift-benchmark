# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets and enhance our overall security posture. By implementing robust authentication measures, we can reduce risks and improve our return on investment in cybersecurity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization. It encompasses all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This adds an essential layer of security beyond just passwords. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. We will implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be defined for the uptime of identity providers to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly to ensure compliance with security standards.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties assessed based on the severity of the breach. The escalation timeline for addressing violations will be within 48 hours of detection.

## Network Access Control Policy

### Purpose
This policy is designed to restrict network access to authorized personnel only, thereby enhancing our security framework through a Zero Trust architecture. By implementing strict access controls, we can protect sensitive information and reduce potential threats.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions will be governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their roles. Administrative access will be managed through a Bastion Host, which serves as a secure gateway. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and monitoring will be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect any anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but it will require a post-incident review to ensure accountability. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to identify unauthorized access attempts. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties determined based on the nature of the breach.

## Data Protection Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Sensitive data must be encrypted when Data At Rest, using AES-256 encryption standards. Additionally, Data In Transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) will be implemented for certificate management, ensuring secure communications. Compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data handling requirements is mandatory.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action.

---

## Incident Response Policy

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. A swift and organized response not only protects our assets but also enhances our reputation in the market.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system will be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege will be followed to limit access to sensitive information. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions will be made; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned will be documented to improve future responses. Penalties for non-compliance will be assessed based on the severity of the incident, with escalation timelines set at 72 hours for reporting findings.

## Cloud Storage Security Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring that sensitive data is protected while maximizing operational efficiency. By implementing strong security measures, we can leverage cloud technology to drive innovation and growth.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions utilized by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but they must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored through regular audits, with penalties for non-compliance determined based on the risk posed to the organization.
