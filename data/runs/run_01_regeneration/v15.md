# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication methods, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. For example, if a legacy application cannot support MFA, it must be documented and reviewed monthly. Additionally, isolated systems may use local authentication, but these exceptions must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties may include a warning for the first violation, a temporary suspension for the second, and permanent access revocation for the third. All incidents will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) within 48 hours.

## Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions must be governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Administrative access should be conducted through a Bastion Host to minimize exposure. Networks must be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and all access must be monitored using Endpoint Telemetry to detect any anomalies.

### Exceptions
In emergencies, access may be granted with a post-incident review. For instance, if a critical system fails, temporary access may be allowed, but it must be documented and reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include a warning for the first incident, a suspension for the second, and potential termination for repeated offenses.

## Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
All sensitive data must be encrypted when at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) must be implemented for certificate management, ensuring secure communications. Additionally, all data handling must comply with GDPR requirements to protect personal information.

### Exceptions
In test environments, relaxed encryption may be permitted, but production data must never be used in these environments. For example, if a test system requires data for functionality testing, it must use anonymized data only.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO, and penalties may include fines or disciplinary action depending on the severity of the violation.

## Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. By preparing for incidents, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems should be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege must be followed to limit access to necessary personnel only. Forensic analysis should utilize an Air Gap to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response. For example, even minor incidents must be logged and reviewed to identify potential improvements.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned must be documented. Penalties for failing to follow incident response procedures may include a warning for the first infraction, a suspension for the second, and potential termination for repeated failures.

## Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and compliance with industry standards. By protecting our cloud data, we enhance operational efficiency and safeguard our reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits must be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects requiring relaxed security measures, but these must be documented and reviewed. For instance, if a project requires rapid deployment, it may use less stringent access controls, but this must be justified and approved.

### Enforcement
Compliance with this policy will be monitored through regular audits. Non-compliance may result in penalties, including fines or restrictions on cloud access.
