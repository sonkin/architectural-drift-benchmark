# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Password Policy

### Purpose
This policy sets rules for creating secure passwords. It helps protect our organization's information.

### Scope
This applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems that need passwords.

### Directives
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in passwords. Change passwords every three months. Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt. Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles. Protect Data At Rest with strong encryption methods.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication for a short time. Document any exceptions. Review them every month.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This policy limits network access to authorized users. It supports a Zero Trust approach.

### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative tasks. Separate networks based on sensitivity. Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry. Ensure Data In Transit is encrypted to prevent interception.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a review afterward. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to keep sensitive data safe. It ensures we follow SOC2 standards.

### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data.

### Directives
Encrypt data stored using AES-256. Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3. Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates. Follow GDPR rules for handling data. Understand the Kill Chain to improve our defenses.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy outlines how to respond quickly to security issues. It aims to reduce damage.

### Scope
This applies to all security events and personnel involved in responses.

### Directives
Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats. Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Identity Federation

### Purpose
This policy allows secure single sign-on. It helps reduce password fatigue.

### Scope
This applies to all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications. Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Monitor federation logs. Report any anomalies.

---

## 6. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy ensures safe data storage in the cloud. It protects against unauthorized access.

### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt data stored using AES-256. Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3. Implement strict access controls. Regularly check compliance with relevant regulations.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud storage access logs monthly. Report non-compliance to the security team.
