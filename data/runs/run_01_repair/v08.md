# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This applies to all employees, contractors, and corporate applications. It covers all systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Ensure that passwords include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to enhance security.
3. **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to prompt users to update their passwords regularly.
4. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing, making them more secure.
5. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles.** Maintain a password history to prevent users from recycling old passwords.
6. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement fingerprint or facial recognition systems for sensitive areas.
7. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications.
8. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** This enables single sign-on capabilities for legacy applications.
9. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to guarantee access.
10. **Ensure Data At Rest is encrypted to protect sensitive information.** Use encryption methods to secure data stored on devices and servers.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Monitor federation logs for anomalies. Repeated violations may lead to losing access.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This policy safeguards our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A secure network enhances productivity and protects our business assets.

### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for administrative tasks.** This secure server acts as a gateway for accessing sensitive systems.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Collect and analyze data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior.
5. **Ensure Data In Transit is encrypted to prevent interception.** Use encryption protocols to secure data being transmitted over the network.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a review afterward. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy ensures the protection of sensitive data, aligning with SOC2 standards. Strong data protection enhances customer trust and drives business growth.

### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored using AES-256.** Implement this encryption standard to protect data at rest from unauthorized access.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** Use this protocol to secure data in transit and prevent eavesdropping.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** This system helps in issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates securely.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for handling data.** Ensure compliance with regulations regarding data protection and privacy for individuals.
5. **Understand the Kill Chain to improve our defenses.** Familiarize yourself with the stages of a cyber attack to enhance security measures.
6. **Adopt a Zero Trust model for data access.** This approach requires verification for every access request, regardless of location.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our organization's reputation and assets.

### Scope
This applies to all security events and personnel involved in responses.

### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data from across the organization.
2. **Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats.** These decoy systems lure attackers, allowing us to study their methods.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Grant only the necessary access to personnel involved in incident response.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise during investigations.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy ensures secure data storage in the cloud. Protecting data enhances operational efficiency and supports our strategic business objectives.

### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored using AES-256.** This encryption standard protects data at rest in cloud environments.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** Use this protocol to secure data in transit to and from cloud services.
3. **Implement strict access controls.** Define and enforce user permissions to limit access to sensitive data.
4. **Regularly check compliance with relevant regulations.** Conduct audits to ensure adherence to legal and regulatory requirements.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud storage access logs monthly. Report non-compliance to the security team.

## 6. Glossary

### Purpose
This section defines key terms used in the Cybersecurity Policy. Understanding these terms is essential for compliance and effective implementation.

### Scope
This glossary applies to all personnel involved in cybersecurity practices within the organization.
