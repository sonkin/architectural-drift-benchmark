# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security Policies

### 1.1 Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency. See Section 1.2.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees, contractors, and corporate applications. It covers all systems requiring authentication. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. See Section 1.2.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Ensure that passwords include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to enhance security. See Section 1.2.
3. **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to prompt users to update their passwords regularly. See Section 1.2.
4. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing, making them more secure. See Section 1.2.
5. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles.** Maintain a password history to prevent users from recycling old passwords. See Section 1.2.
6. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement fingerprint or facial recognition systems for sensitive areas. See Section 1.2.
7. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications. See Section 1.2.
8. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** This enables single sign-on capabilities for legacy applications. See Section 1.2.
9. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to guarantee access. See Section 1.2.
10. **Ensure Data At Rest is encrypted to protect sensitive information.** Use encryption methods to secure data stored on devices and servers. See Section 1.2.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually. See Section 1.3.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time offenders will face a $500 fine and a warning. Repeat violations within six months will result in a $1,000 fine and a mandatory training session. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for up to 30 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further review. See Section 1.3.

### 1.2 Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A secure network enhances productivity and protects our business assets. See Section 1.3.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. See Section 1.3.

#### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. See Section 1.3.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for administrative tasks.** This secure server acts as a gateway for accessing sensitive systems. See Section 1.3.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. See Section 1.3.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Collect and analyze data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior. See Section 1.3.
5. **Ensure Data In Transit is encrypted to prevent interception.** Use encryption protocols to secure data being transmitted over the network. See Section 1.3.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a review afterward. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $750 fine for the first offense. A second violation within a year will result in a $1,500 fine and a review of access privileges. If violations continue, access may be suspended for up to 60 days. All cases will be escalated to the security team for further action. See Section 1.1.

### 1.3 Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy ensures the protection of sensitive data, aligning with SOC2 standards. Strong data protection enhances customer trust and drives business growth. See Section 1.4.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data. See Section 1.4.

#### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored using AES-256.** Implement this encryption standard to protect data at rest from unauthorized access. See Section 1.4.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** Use this protocol to secure data in transit and prevent eavesdropping. See Section 1.4.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** This system helps in issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates securely. See Section 1.4.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for handling data.** Ensure compliance with regulations regarding data protection and privacy for individuals. See Section 1.4.
5. **Understand the Kill Chain to improve our defenses.** Familiarize yourself with the stages of a cyber attack to enhance security measures. See Section 1.4.
6. **Adopt a Zero Trust model for data access.** This approach requires verification for every access request, regardless of location. See Section 1.4.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
First violations will incur a $1,000 fine. A second violation within six months will result in a $2,000 fine and mandatory retraining. Continued violations may lead to access suspension for 90 days. All incidents will be escalated to the CISO for further review. See Section 1.1.

### 1.4 Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our organization's reputation and assets. See Section 1.5.

#### Scope
This applies to all security events and personnel involved in responses. See Section 1.5.

#### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data from across the organization. See Section 1.5.
2. **Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats.** These decoy systems lure attackers, allowing us to study their methods. See Section 1.5.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Grant only the necessary access to personnel involved in incident response. See Section 1.5.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise during investigations. See Section 1.5.

#### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $1,500 fine for the first offense. A second violation within a year will result in a $3,000 fine and a mandatory review of incident response procedures. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for 60 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further action. See Section 1.1.
