# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security Policies

### 1.1 Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency. Remember to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security. See Section 1.2.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees, contractors, and corporate applications. It covers all systems requiring authentication. Always follow the Zero Trust model for access. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
All important systems must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to enhance security. Users must change passwords every three months, with reminders set to prompt regular updates. Passwords must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt, which adds random data to passwords before hashing, making them more secure. Users must keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles, maintaining a password history to prevent recycling. Biometric verification is required for high-security access, implementing fingerprint or facial recognition systems for sensitive areas. OpenID Connect (OIDC) must be used for modern applications, allowing secure authentication and authorization for web applications. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) should be supported for older systems, enabling single sign-on capabilities for legacy applications. Service Level Agreements (SLA) must be set for identity provider uptime, ensuring that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to guarantee access. Finally, Data At Rest must be encrypted to protect sensitive information, using encryption methods to secure data stored on devices and servers. Always remember to apply the Zero Trust model for every access request. See Section 1.3.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually. Ensure MFA is implemented where possible. See Section 1.3.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time offenders will face a $500 fine and a warning. Repeat violations within six months will result in a $1,000 fine and a mandatory training session. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for up to 30 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further review. Remember, adherence to MFA and Zero Trust principles is crucial. See Section 1.3.

### 1.2 Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A secure network enhances productivity and protects our business assets. Always apply Zero Trust principles for network access. See Section 1.3.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. Ensure MFA is used for all network access. See Section 1.3.

#### Directives
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be used for access decisions, assigning permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. A Bastion Host should be used for administrative tasks, acting as a secure gateway for accessing sensitive systems. Networks must be separated based on sensitivity, creating distinct segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Activity must be monitored with Endpoint Telemetry, collecting and analyzing data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior. Data In Transit must be encrypted to prevent interception, using encryption protocols to secure data being transmitted over the network. Always remember to implement MFA for critical access points. See Section 1.3.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a review afterward. Ensure MFA is applied wherever feasible. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $750 fine for the first offense. A second violation within a year will result in a $1,500 fine and a review of access privileges. If violations continue, access may be suspended for up to 60 days. All cases will be escalated to the security team for further action. Remember to adhere to Zero Trust and MFA principles. See Section 1.1.

### 1.3 Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy ensures the protection of sensitive data, aligning with SOC2 standards. Strong data protection enhances customer trust and drives business growth. Always apply Zero Trust principles to data access. See Section 1.4.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data. Ensure MFA is used for accessing sensitive data. See Section 1.4.

#### Directives
Data stored must be encrypted using AES-256, implementing this encryption standard to protect data at rest from unauthorized access. Data being sent must be encrypted using TLS 1.3, securing data in transit and preventing eavesdropping. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) must be used for managing certificates, helping in issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates securely. GDPR rules must be followed for handling data, ensuring compliance with regulations regarding data protection and privacy for individuals. Understanding the Kill Chain is essential to improve our defenses, familiarizing personnel with the stages of a cyber attack to enhance security measures. A Zero Trust model must be adopted for data access, requiring verification for every access request, regardless of location. Always remember to use MFA for sensitive data access. See Section 1.4.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests. Ensure MFA is applied in all environments. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
First violations will incur a $1,000 fine. A second violation within six months will result in a $2,000 fine and mandatory retraining. Continued violations may lead to access suspension for 90 days. All incidents will be escalated to the CISO for further review. Remember to adhere to Zero Trust and MFA principles. See Section 1.1.

### 1.4 Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our organization's reputation and assets. Always apply Zero Trust principles during incident response. See Section 1.5.

#### Scope
This applies to all security events and personnel involved in responses. Ensure MFA is used for accessing incident response tools. See Section 1.5.

#### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must be used for logging, collecting and analyzing security data from across the organization. Honeypot systems must be maintained to detect threats, luring attackers to study their methods. The Least Privilege principle must be followed during investigations, granting only the necessary access to personnel involved in incident response. An Air Gap must be used for forensic analysis, isolating affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise during investigations. Always remember to implement MFA for incident response access. See Section 1.5.

#### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response. Ensure MFA is applied consistently. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $1,500 fine for the first offense. A second violation within a year will result in a $3,000 fine and a mandatory review of incident response procedures. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for 60 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further action. Remember to adhere to Zero Trust and MFA principles. See Section 1.1.

## 2. HR Policies

#### Directives
Data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using AES-256, protecting data at rest in cloud environments. Data being sent must be encrypted using TLS 1.3, securing data in transit to and from cloud services. Strict access controls must be implemented, defining and enforcing user permissions to limit access to sensitive data. Regular compliance checks with relevant regulations must be conducted, ensuring adherence to legal and regulatory requirements. Always remember to implement MFA for cloud storage access. See Section 1.4.

#### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions. Ensure MFA is applied wherever possible. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
First violations will incur a $500 fine. A second violation within six months will result in a $1,000 fine and a mandatory compliance review.
