# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## IT Security Policies

### Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security. See Section Network Access Control.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees, contractors, and corporate applications. It covers all systems requiring authentication. Follow the Zero Trust model for access. See Section Network Access Control.

#### Directives
All important systems must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Users must provide two or more verification factors to gain access. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to enhance security. Users must change passwords every three months. Set reminders to prompt regular updates. Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt. This adds random data to passwords before hashing, enhancing security. Users must track old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles. Maintain a password history to prevent recycling. Biometric verification is required for high-security access. Implement fingerprint or facial recognition systems for sensitive areas. Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications. This allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications. Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems. This enables single sign-on capabilities for legacy applications. Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime. Ensure identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to guarantee access. Encrypt Data At Rest to protect sensitive information. Use encryption methods to secure data stored on devices and servers. Apply the Zero Trust model for every access request. See Section Data Protection.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. For example, if a legacy application does not support MFA, it may be allowed for a limited time. Isolated systems may use local authentication. This applies to systems not connected to the corporate network. Document and review these exceptions annually. Ensure MFA is implemented where possible. If a user is unable to use MFA due to a disability, alternative methods must be documented and approved. See Section Data Protection.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time offenders will face a $500 fine and a warning. Repeat violations within six months will result in a $1,000 fine and a mandatory training session. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for up to 30 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further review. Adherence to MFA and Zero Trust principles is crucial. See Section Data Protection.

### Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A secure network enhances productivity and protects our business assets. Apply Zero Trust principles for network access. See Section Data Protection.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. Ensure MFA is used for all network access. See Section Data Protection.

#### Directives
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for access decisions. Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. A Bastion Host should be used for administrative tasks. This acts as a secure gateway for accessing sensitive systems. Separate networks based on sensitivity. Create distinct segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry. Collect and analyze data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior. Encrypt Data In Transit to prevent interception. Use encryption protocols to secure data being transmitted over the network. Implement MFA for critical access points. See Section Data Protection.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a review afterward. For instance, if a system administrator needs immediate access during a network outage, this may be granted temporarily. Ensure MFA is applied wherever feasible. If a user cannot access MFA due to technical issues, a temporary bypass may be allowed with proper documentation. All exceptions must be reviewed and approved by the security team. See Section Authentication.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $750 fine for the first offense. A second violation within a year will result in a $1,500 fine and a review of access privileges. If violations continue, access may be suspended for up to 60 days. All cases will be escalated to the security team for further action. Adhere to Zero Trust and MFA principles. See Section Authentication.

### Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy ensures the protection of sensitive data, aligning with SOC2 standards. Strong data protection enhances customer trust and drives business growth. Apply Zero Trust principles to data access. See Section Incident Response.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data. Ensure MFA is used for accessing sensitive data. See Section Incident Response.

#### Directives
Data stored must be encrypted using AES-256. Implement this encryption standard to protect data at rest from unauthorized access. Data being sent must be encrypted using TLS 1.3. This secures data in transit and prevents eavesdropping. Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates. This helps in issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates securely. Follow GDPR rules for handling data. Ensure compliance with regulations regarding data protection and privacy for individuals. Understanding the Kill Chain is essential to improve our defenses. Familiarize personnel with the stages of a cyber attack to enhance security measures. Adopt a Zero Trust model for data access. Require verification for every access request, regardless of location. Use MFA for sensitive data access. See Section Incident Response.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. For example, developers may use weaker encryption during initial testing phases. Never use production data in tests. This ensures sensitive information remains protected. Ensure MFA is applied in all environments. If a testing environment lacks MFA capabilities, document the reason and seek approval for the exception. See Section Authentication.

#### Enforcement
First violations will incur a $1,000 fine. A second violation within six months will result in a $2,000 fine and mandatory retraining. Continued violations may lead to access suspension for 90 days. All incidents will be escalated to the CISO for further review. Adhere to Zero Trust and MFA principles. See Section Authentication.

### Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our organization's reputation and assets. Apply Zero Trust principles during incident response. See Section Cloud Storage Security.

#### Scope
This applies to all security events and personnel involved in responses. Ensure MFA is used for accessing incident response tools. See Section Cloud Storage Security.

#### Directives
Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging. This collects and analyzes security data from across the organization. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats. These lure attackers to study their methods. Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. Grant only the necessary access to personnel involved in incident response. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis. This isolates affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise during investigations. Implement MFA for incident response access. See Section Cloud Storage Security.

#### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response. Ensure MFA is applied consistently. If a user cannot access MFA due to a system failure, document the incident and seek alternative verification methods. All exceptions must be reported to the security team. See Section Authentication.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $1,500 fine for the first offense. A second violation within a year will result in a $3,000 fine and a mandatory review of incident response procedures. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for 60 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further action. Adhere to Zero Trust and MFA principles. See Section Authentication.
