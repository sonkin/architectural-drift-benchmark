# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Establish robust authentication practices to enhance security and streamline user access. By implementing secure password protocols and single sign-on solutions, we not only protect our organization's valuable information but also improve employee productivity and satisfaction through simplified access.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems that require a password, including all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification).
   
2. **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** To create a strong password, users should combine random words, numbers, and symbols, ensuring that it is not easily guessable and does not contain personal information.

3. **Change passwords every three months.** Users will receive reminders to update their passwords, and they should follow the established guidelines for creating a new password that meets the security criteria.

4. **Store passwords securely.** Utilize password managers to store and encrypt passwords, ensuring that they are not written down or stored in easily accessible locations.

5. **Keep track of the last 5 passwords to prevent reuse.** Implement a system that automatically checks new passwords against the last five used to ensure compliance with this directive.

6. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** When integrating new applications, ensure that OIDC is configured correctly to facilitate secure authentication and authorization.

7. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** For legacy systems, ensure that SAML is implemented to allow secure single sign-on capabilities.

8. **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric systems such as fingerprint or facial recognition for users accessing sensitive information or systems.

9. **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, with defined penalties for non-compliance.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Implementing stringent network access controls is essential for safeguarding our digital assets and fostering a culture of security within the organization. By adopting a Zero Trust approach, we not only protect sensitive information but also enhance operational efficiency and trust among stakeholders.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on the roles of users within the organization, ensuring that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions.

2. **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure that administrative tasks are performed on dedicated, secure servers that are isolated from general user access to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes.

3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible through secure channels.

4. **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor and analyze endpoint activity for signs of suspicious behavior.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive information is not just a compliance requirement; it is a strategic imperative that enhances our reputation and builds customer trust. By ensuring robust data protection measures, we safeguard our assets and position ourselves as a leader in data security, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
Includes all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Protect stored data with strong encryption.** Utilize industry-standard encryption algorithms to secure data at rest, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access or read the data without proper decryption keys.

2. **Secure data in transit using the latest encryption methods.** Implement protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data being transmitted over networks, protecting it from interception during transfer.

3. **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Establish a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization.

4. **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR requirements, including obtaining consent, providing data access rights, and ensuring data portability.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed security measures. Never use production data in testing.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
A well-defined incident response plan is crucial for minimizing the impact of security incidents and protecting our organizational integrity. By swiftly addressing security events, we not only mitigate potential damage but also reinforce our commitment to security excellence, enhancing stakeholder confidence.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** Implement a SIEM solution to collect, analyze, and correlate security event data from across the organization, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting.

2. **Maintain decoy systems to detect threats.** Deploy honeypots and other decoy systems to lure potential attackers, allowing the organization to detect and analyze intrusion attempts without risking actual assets.

3. **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that personnel involved in incident response have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties, reducing the risk of further compromise.

4. **Use a secure method for forensic analysis.** Establish protocols for conducting forensic investigations that ensure the integrity of evidence and maintain confidentiality throughout the process.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensuring the security of data stored in cloud services is vital for maintaining our competitive edge and protecting our intellectual property. By implementing stringent cloud storage security measures, we not only safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches but also enhance our operational resilience and customer trust.

### Scope
Covers all data stored in cloud services and all personnel with access to cloud storage.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt all data both when stored and when being transferred.** Implement encryption solutions that protect data at rest in cloud storage and during transmission to and from cloud services, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.

2. **Use strict access controls and ensure that only necessary permissions are granted.** Regularly review user access rights and implement the principle of least privilege to limit access to sensitive data only to those who require it for their roles.

3. **Regularly review and update who has access.** Conduct periodic audits of user access to cloud storage, removing any unnecessary permissions and ensuring that access is aligned with current job responsibilities.

4. **Comply with relevant regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.** Ensure that all cloud storage practices adhere to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including data protection and privacy laws.

5. **Conduct regular security checks on cloud service providers.** Evaluate the security measures and compliance status of cloud service providers through regular assessments and audits to ensure they meet organizational security standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud access logs monthly. Report any non-compliance to the CISO.
