# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Department

### Purpose
Establish robust cybersecurity practices to enhance security and streamline user access. By implementing secure protocols and solutions, we protect our organization's valuable information and improve operational efficiency.

### Scope
Applies to all systems managed by the IT department, including corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
- **Authentication:**
  - **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system.
  - **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** Users should combine random words, numbers, and symbols.
  - **Change passwords every three months.** Users will receive reminders to update their passwords.
  - **Store passwords securely.** Utilize password managers to store and encrypt passwords.
  - **Keep track of the last 5 passwords to prevent reuse.** Implement a system that checks new passwords against the last five used.
  - **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** Ensure OIDC is configured correctly for new applications.
  - **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** Ensure SAML is implemented for legacy systems.
  - **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric systems for users accessing sensitive information.
  - **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish SLAs with identity providers.

- **Network Access Control:**
  - **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles.
  - **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure administrative tasks are performed on dedicated, secure servers.
  - **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity.
  - **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

- **Data Protection:**
  - **Protect stored data with strong encryption.** Utilize industry-standard encryption algorithms.
  - **Secure data in transit using the latest encryption methods.** Implement protocols such as TLS.
  - **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Establish a PKI for secure communications.
  - **Conduct regular security checks on cloud service providers.** Evaluate security measures of cloud service providers.

- **Incident Response:**
  - **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** Implement a SIEM solution for real-time monitoring.
  - **Maintain decoy systems to detect threats.** Deploy honeypots to lure potential attackers.
  - **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure personnel have minimum access necessary.
  - **Use a secure method for forensic analysis.** Establish protocols for conducting forensic investigations.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity.

## 2. HR Department

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive employee information is essential for compliance and building trust within the organization. By ensuring robust data protection measures, we safeguard our assets and enhance our reputation.

### Scope
Includes all employee data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
- **Data Protection:**
  - **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure compliance with GDPR requirements, including obtaining consent and providing data access rights.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed security measures. Never use production data in testing.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 3. Legal Department

### Purpose
Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is vital for protecting the organization from legal risks and enhancing our credibility. By adhering to relevant laws, we safeguard our interests and maintain stakeholder trust.

### Scope
Covers all legal obligations related to data protection and cybersecurity.

### Directives
- **Data Protection:**
  - **Comply with relevant regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.** Ensure all practices adhere to applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 4. Finance Department

### Purpose
Implementing stringent security measures for financial data is crucial for protecting organizational assets and maintaining stakeholder confidence. By ensuring robust financial data protection, we enhance our operational resilience.

### Scope
Covers all financial data and systems.

### Directives
- **Cloud Storage Security:**
  - **Encrypt all data both when stored and when being transferred.** Implement encryption solutions for cloud storage.
  - **Use strict access controls and ensure that only necessary permissions are granted.** Regularly review user access rights.
  - **Regularly review and update who has access.** Conduct periodic audits of user access to cloud storage.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud access logs monthly. Report any non-compliance to the CISO.
