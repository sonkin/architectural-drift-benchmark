### Scope
Applies to all systems managed by the IT department, including corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
- **Authentication:**
  - **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** Users should combine random words, numbers, and symbols. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Change passwords every three months.** Users will receive reminders to update their passwords. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Store passwords securely.** Utilize password managers to store and encrypt passwords. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Keep track of the last 5 passwords to prevent reuse.** Implement a system that checks new passwords against the last five used. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** Ensure OIDC is configured correctly for new applications. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** Ensure SAML is implemented for legacy systems. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric systems for users accessing sensitive information. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish SLAs with identity providers. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Network Access Control:**
  - **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure administrative tasks are performed on dedicated, secure servers. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Data Protection:**
  - **Protect stored data with strong encryption.** Utilize industry-standard encryption algorithms. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Secure data in transit using the latest encryption methods.** Implement protocols such as TLS. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Establish a PKI for secure communications. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Conduct regular security checks on cloud service providers.** Evaluate security measures of cloud service providers. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Incident Response:**
  - **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** Implement a SIEM solution for real-time monitoring. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Maintain decoy systems to detect threats.** Deploy honeypots to lure potential attackers. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure personnel have minimum access necessary. See Section 5 for definitions.
  - **Use a secure method for forensic analysis.** Establish protocols for conducting forensic investigations. See Section 5 for definitions.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Document any exceptions and review them monthly. See Section 2 for related exceptions.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. For first-time violations, a warning will be issued, and the user will be required to complete a mandatory cybersecurity training session within 30 days. For second violations, a fine of $250 will be imposed, and the user will lose access to the affected systems for 14 days. For third violations, a fine of $500 will be imposed, and the user will be suspended from all systems for 30 days. Repeated violations beyond the third instance may lead to termination of employment. Additionally, the security team will monitor federation logs for unusual activity and escalate any findings to upper management for further action. See Section 2 for related enforcement measures.

## 2. HR Department

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive employee information is essential for compliance and building trust within the organization. By ensuring robust data protection measures, we safeguard our assets and enhance our reputation.

### Scope
Includes all employee data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
- **Data Protection:**
  - **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure compliance with GDPR requirements, including obtaining consent and providing data access rights. See Section 5 for definitions.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed security measures. Never use production data in testing. See Section 1 for related exceptions.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. For any non-compliance identified, the responsible individual will receive a written warning and must rectify the issue within 15 days. Failure to comply will result in a fine of $300 and a mandatory review meeting with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Continued non-compliance may lead to further disciplinary action, including potential termination. See Section 1 for related enforcement measures.

## 3. Legal Department

### Purpose
Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is vital for protecting the organization from legal risks and enhancing our credibility. By adhering to relevant laws, we safeguard our interests and maintain stakeholder trust.

### Scope
Covers all legal obligations related to data protection and cybersecurity.

### Directives
- **Data Protection:**
  - **Comply with relevant regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.** Ensure all practices adhere to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. See Section 5 for definitions.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response. See Section 1 for related exceptions.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. For any failure to comply with legal obligations, the responsible party will incur a fine of $500 and must submit a corrective action plan within 30 days. Repeated failures may result in increased fines and potential legal action against the individual or department involved. See Section 1 for related enforcement measures.

## 4. Finance Department

### Purpose
Implementing stringent security measures for financial data is crucial for protecting organizational assets and maintaining stakeholder confidence. By ensuring robust financial data protection, we enhance our operational resilience.

### Scope
Covers all financial data and systems.

### Directives
- **Cloud Storage Security:**
