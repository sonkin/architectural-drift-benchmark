# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## IT Department

### Purpose
Establish robust cybersecurity practices to enhance security and streamline user access. By implementing secure protocols and solutions, we protect our organization's valuable information and improve operational efficiency. **Remember, adopting a Zero Trust approach is essential, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be utilized wherever possible.**

### Scope
Applies to all systems managed by the IT department, including corporate applications and external partner systems. **Always apply Zero Trust principles and ensure MFA is enforced for all access.**

### Directives
Authentication measures include the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems, which requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character; users are encouraged to combine random words, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be changed every three months, with users receiving reminders to update them. It is essential to store passwords securely by utilizing password managers to encrypt them. Users should keep track of the last five passwords to prevent reuse, and a system must be implemented to check new passwords against the last five used. For modern applications, OpenID Connect (OIDC) should be used, ensuring it is configured correctly for new applications. Older systems should support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), which must be implemented for legacy systems. Biometric verification is required for high-security access, necessitating the implementation of biometric systems for users accessing sensitive information. Additionally, service level agreements (SLA) should be set for identity provider uptime, establishing SLAs with identity providers. **Reinforce the Zero Trust model by continuously verifying user identities and employing MFA for all critical systems.**

Network access control should employ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions, assigning permissions based on user roles. Administrative tasks must be performed on dedicated, secure servers, and networks should be separated based on sensitivity, creating distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity. Activity must be monitored with endpoint tracking by implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. **Maintain a Zero Trust mindset by ensuring that all access requests are authenticated and authorized, utilizing MFA as a standard practice.**

Data protection requires that stored data be protected with strong encryption, utilizing industry-standard encryption algorithms. Data in transit must be secured using the latest encryption methods, implementing protocols such as TLS. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) should be used for managing certificates, establishing a PKI for secure communications. Regular security checks on cloud service providers are necessary to evaluate their security measures. **Always apply Zero Trust principles to data protection and ensure MFA is in place for sensitive data access.**

Incident response should utilize a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging, implementing a SIEM solution for real-time monitoring. Decoy systems must be maintained to detect threats, deploying honeypots to lure potential attackers. The principle of Least Privilege should be followed during investigations, ensuring personnel have the minimum access necessary. A secure method for forensic analysis must be established, creating protocols for conducting forensic investigations. **In incident response, remember to apply Zero Trust principles and utilize MFA to verify identities before granting access to sensitive information.**

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. For example, if a legacy application does not support MFA due to technical limitations, it may be necessary to allow access with a password alone until an upgrade can be implemented. Document any exceptions and review them monthly. See the HR Department for related exceptions. **Even in exceptions, strive to implement Zero Trust and MFA wherever feasible.**

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. For first-time violations, a warning will be issued, and the user will be required to complete a mandatory cybersecurity training session within 30 days. For second violations, a fine of $250 will be imposed, and the user will lose access to the affected systems for 14 days. For third violations, a fine of $500 will be imposed, and the user will be suspended from all systems for 30 days. Repeated violations beyond the third instance may lead to termination of employment. Additionally, the security team will monitor federation logs for unusual activity and escalate any findings to upper management for further action. See the HR Department for related enforcement measures. **Ensure that enforcement actions also emphasize the importance of Zero Trust and MFA compliance.**

## HR Department

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive employee information is essential for compliance and building trust within the organization. By ensuring robust data protection measures, we safeguard our assets and enhance our reputation. **Incorporate Zero Trust principles and MFA in all employee data handling processes.**

### Scope
Includes all employee data classified as sensitive or higher. **Apply Zero Trust and MFA to all access to sensitive employee data.**

### Directives
Data protection must follow GDPR guidelines for handling data, ensuring compliance with GDPR requirements, including obtaining consent and providing data access rights. See the Glossary for definitions. **Always implement Zero Trust and MFA when accessing or processing sensitive employee information.**

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed security measures. For instance, during the development of a new HR software application, developers may need to access test data that does not contain real employee information. However, production data must never be used in testing environments to prevent exposure of sensitive information. Document and review all exceptions. See the IT Department for related exceptions. **Even in testing, strive to apply Zero Trust principles and utilize MFA where possible.**

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. For any non-compliance identified, the responsible individual will receive a written warning and must rectify the issue within 15 days. Failure to comply will result in a fine of $300 and a mandatory review meeting with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Continued non-compliance may lead to further disciplinary action, including potential termination. See the IT Department for related enforcement measures. **Emphasize the importance of Zero Trust and MFA compliance during audits and enforcement actions.**

## Legal Department

### Purpose
Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is vital for protecting the organization from legal risks and enhancing our credibility. By adhering to relevant laws, we safeguard our interests and maintain stakeholder trust. **Incorporate Zero Trust principles and MFA in all legal data handling processes.**

### Scope
Covers all legal obligations related to data protection and cybersecurity. **Apply Zero Trust and MFA to all access to legal data.**

### Directives
Data protection must comply with relevant regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring all practices adhere to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. See the Glossary for definitions. **Always implement Zero Trust and MFA when accessing or processing legal data.**

### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response. For example, if a legal team needs to access sensitive data for a case, they must follow the established protocols, even if the data is in a less secure environment. See the IT Department for related exceptions. **Even in the absence of exceptions, maintain a Zero Trust approach and utilize MFA for all legal data access.**

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. For any failure to comply with legal obligations, the responsible party will incur a fine of $500 and must submit a corrective action plan within 30 days. Repeated failures may result in increased fines and potential legal action against the individual or department involved. See the IT Department for related enforcement measures. **Ensure that enforcement actions highlight the necessity of Zero Trust and MFA compliance.**
