# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Password Policy

### Purpose
This policy defines secure authentication standards to protect our organizational assets.

### Scope
It applies to all employees and contractors using systems that require authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section restricts network access to authorized personnel and implements a Zero Trust architecture.

### Scope
It covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle and ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements.

### Scope
It applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements strictly.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This section establishes a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
It covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
There are no exceptions. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned for future reference.

---

## 5. Identity Federation

### Purpose
This policy enables secure single sign-on capabilities to reduce password fatigue.

### Scope
It applies to all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Monitor federation logs regularly. Anomalies will trigger alerts for further investigation.

---

## 6. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This section ensures the security of data stored in the cloud.

### Scope
It applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud. Implement access controls based on RBAC. Ensure compliance with GDPR and other relevant regulations.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions regularly.

### Enforcement
Conduct regular audits of cloud storage security. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO.
