# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance user experience. This approach reduces risks and improves operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and history tracking must prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. For corporate applications, implement OIDC for modern systems and SAML for legacy systems. High-security access requires Biometric verification. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture enhances security and minimizes risks.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity to limit exposure. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to maintain trust and comply with regulations. This approach protects our reputation and reduces potential liabilities.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Ensure compliance with GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response framework for security incidents to minimize damage and ensure business continuity. This proactive approach protects our assets and enhances resilience.

### Scope
This policy covers all security events and involves all personnel engaged in incident response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events effectively. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to capture lessons learned and improve future responses.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect sensitive information and maintain compliance. This enhances our operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations and standards to ensure data protection.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the established security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly.
