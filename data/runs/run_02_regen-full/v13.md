# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our valuable assets. Strong authentication practices lead to reduced risks and improved operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be rotated quarterly, and history tracking requires the last five passwords to be unique. Store all credentials using Cryptographic Salt for added protection. For corporate applications, implement OIDC for modern systems and support SAML for legacy systems. High-security access must require Biometric verification.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation within 30 days. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access to authorized personnel enhances security and protects sensitive information. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures that only verified users can access resources.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure users have the least privilege necessary. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity to minimize risk. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry for real-time insights.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with findings reported within 14 days.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. Effective data protection strategies enhance our reputation and reduce potential liabilities.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to safeguard stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission. Implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to maintain compliance and protect user privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO within 30 days for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establishing a rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our assets. A well-defined incident response strategy enhances our resilience and operational continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
Deploy a SIEM for centralized logging to facilitate monitoring and analysis. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection and proactive defense. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, with findings documented within 14 days. Lessons learned will be shared with relevant teams to improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and ensures compliance with industry standards. Effective cloud security enhances our operational efficiency and reduces risks associated with data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using AES-256. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access based on user roles. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but must be documented and reviewed quarterly.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored through regular audits. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO within 30 days for corrective action.
