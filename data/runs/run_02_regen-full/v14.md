# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our assets. This policy ensures a robust framework for identity verification.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly. Historical passwords must not be reused within the last five cycles. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. For corporate applications, implement OIDC for modern systems and SAML for legacy systems. High-security access requires Biometric verification. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Penalties may include access revocation after three violations within six months.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access enhances security and protects sensitive information. This policy supports our Zero Trust architecture.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access will trigger an investigation, with penalties of up to $5,000 for breaches.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. This policy aligns with our commitment to security.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption, but production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance may result in penalties of up to $10,000, escalating to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
A rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our reputation. This policy utilizes the Kill Chain analysis for effective management.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Failure to comply may result in penalties of up to $7,500, with escalation to senior management.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and enhances operational efficiency. This policy ensures compliance and mitigates risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256. Implement access controls based on RBAC principles. Ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements for cloud services.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but must be documented and reviewed quarterly.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored through regular audits. Non-compliance may incur penalties of up to $5,000, with escalation to the CISO.
