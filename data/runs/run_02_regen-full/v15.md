# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our assets. Strong authentication methods improve security and reduce risks, leading to better business outcomes.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. It covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly and tracked historically for compliance. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may also use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation. Authentication logs will be monitored for compliance.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access to authorized personnel enhances security. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture ensures that only verified users can access sensitive resources.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. It applies to all employees and contractors accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure proper permissions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels and monitor them using Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. Document all emergency access instances. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle is crucial for compliance and trust. Effective data protection strategies enhance our reputation and reduce potential liabilities.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. It includes all employees and contractors handling such data.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to safeguard stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission. Implement PKI for certificate management and follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments. Document all exceptions for review.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establishing a rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our assets. A well-defined incident response strategy enhances our resilience and reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in incident response. It includes all employees and contractors.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats proactively. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response. This ensures accountability and thorough investigation.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to identify lessons learned. Document all findings to improve future responses and strategies.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and enhances compliance. Effective cloud security strategies improve operational efficiency and reduce risks associated with data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization. It includes all employees and contractors accessing cloud services.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud to protect against unauthorized access. Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects requiring relaxed security measures. Document all exceptions and review them regularly to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will assess compliance with cloud storage security measures. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO for further action.

## 6. Identity Federation

### Purpose
Enabling secure single sign-on capabilities reduces password fatigue and enhances user experience. Streamlined authentication processes improve productivity and security across the organization.

### Scope
This policy applies to all corporate applications and external partner integrations. It includes all employees and contractors accessing these systems.

### Directives
Implement OIDC for modern applications to enhance security and usability. Support SAML for legacy systems to ensure compatibility. Require Biometric verification for high-security access to sensitive data. Define SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication methods. Document and review these exceptions annually to ensure compliance with security standards.

### Enforcement
Federation logs will be monitored for anomalies. Any detected anomalies will trigger alerts for immediate investigation.
