1. Use MFA for all critical systems.
2. Minimum password length: 12 characters.
3. Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
4. Rotate passwords quarterly.
5. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse.
6. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt.
7. Implement OIDC for modern applications.
8. Support SAML for legacy systems.
9. Require Biometric verification for high-security access.
10. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

2. Use Bastion Host for administrative access.
3. Segment networks by sensitivity.
4. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation.

Establish rapid response to security incidents. Quick action minimizes damage and protects organizational reputation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in response.

### Directives
1. Deploy SIEM for centralized logging.
2. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection.
