# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our valuable assets. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include complexity requirements: upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review annually. Isolated systems may use local authentication.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel. Implementing Zero Trust architecture enhances security and reduces potential threats.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs are reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensuring compliance with SOC2 and GDPR enhances our reputation and builds customer trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits are conducted. Non-compliance is escalated to the CISO.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents. Minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis protects our business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure cloud storage practices. Protecting our data in the cloud enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest and Data In Transit in cloud environments. Implement access controls based on RBAC. Ensure compliance with GDPR and SOC2 requirements.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage practices. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO.
