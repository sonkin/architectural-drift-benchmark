# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets and enhance operational efficiency. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be implemented to prevent reuse. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. See Section 2 for related access control policies.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation, ensuring compliance and security.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and operational integrity. Implementing Zero Trust architecture minimizes potential threats.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels and monitor activities using Endpoint Telemetry for real-time insights.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for authentication-related exceptions.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation to maintain security.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to ensure compliance and protect organizational reputation. Effective data protection enhances customer trust and business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management and adhere to GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance issues will be escalated to the CISO for resolution.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response framework for security incidents to minimize damage and ensure business continuity. Effective incident response protects assets and enhances resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to identify lessons learned. Documentation of these lessons will help improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect sensitive information and maintain compliance. Secure cloud storage enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR, must be maintained to protect data privacy.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure adherence to this policy. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly to maintain security.
