# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances our organizational integrity and protects valuable assets. Strong authentication methods improve user trust and reduce security risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. It covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
Implement MFA for all critical systems. Ensure a minimum password length of 12 characters. Require at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. 

1. Enforce MFA by integrating it into login processes.
2. Set password complexity requirements in system settings.
3. Schedule quarterly password changes and notify users.
4. Maintain a history of previous passwords to prevent reuse.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document these exceptions and review them monthly. For example, if a legacy system cannot support MFA, it must be documented.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team may incur penalties of up to $500. Repeated violations within 30 days may result in access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access to authorized personnel enhances security and protects sensitive information. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures that only verified users can access resources.

### Scope
This policy applies to all network infrastructure and connected devices. It includes all employees and contractors accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

1. Define roles and permissions for RBAC in the access control system.
2. Configure the Bastion Host to limit administrative access.
3. Create network segments based on data sensitivity.
4. Set up Endpoint Telemetry to track device activity.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. For example, if immediate access is needed during a critical incident, document the access granted.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access may incur penalties of up to $1,000. Investigations will be initiated within 48 hours of detection.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. Effective data protection strategies enhance our reputation and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. It includes all employees and contractors handling sensitive data.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements.

1. Use AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data stored.
2. Apply TLS 1.3 for all data transmitted over networks.
3. Set up a PKI system for managing digital certificates.
4. Train employees on GDPR compliance and data handling.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments. For example, if testing a new application, use dummy data.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance may incur penalties of up to $2,000. Escalate serious violations to the CISO within 72 hours.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establishing a rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our assets. A well-defined incident response strategy enhances our resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in incident response. It includes all employees and contractors.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege principles during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

1. Set up SIEM to collect and analyze security logs.
2. Deploy Honeypots to attract and analyze potential threats.
3. Ensure investigators have only the access necessary for their tasks.
4. Isolate forensic analysis systems using an Air Gap.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response. For example, even minor incidents must be logged and reviewed.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Non-compliance may incur penalties of up to $1,500. Document lessons learned within 14 days of an incident.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and ensures compliance with regulations. Effective cloud security strategies enhance operational efficiency and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization. It includes all employees and contractors accessing cloud services.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud. Implement access controls based on RBAC. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR.

1. Use strong encryption methods for all cloud-stored data.
2. Define access roles and permissions for cloud storage.
3. Regularly review compliance with GDPR and other regulations.
4. Monitor cloud access logs for unusual activity.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually. For example, if a project requires relaxed access controls, it must be justified.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted on cloud storage security. Non-compliance may incur penalties of up to $2,500. Escalate serious violations to the CISO within 72 hours.
