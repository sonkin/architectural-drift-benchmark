# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This section defines secure authentication standards to protect our organizational assets and ensure user identity verification.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems that require user authentication.

### Directives
1. **Use MFA**: All critical systems must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Historical password tracking is required; users cannot reuse their last five passwords.
3. **Password Rotation**: Users must change their passwords every three months.
4. **Credential Storage**: Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.
5. **Biometric Verification**: For high-security access, implement Biometric verification methods.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to revocation of access privileges.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section restricts network access to authorized personnel only. It implements a Zero Trust architecture to enhance security.

### Scope
This policy applies to all network infrastructure and all connected devices.

### Directives
1. **RBAC Implementation**: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions. This ensures users only access what they need.
2. **Bastion Host Usage**: Administrative access must go through a Bastion Host to limit exposure.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity to reduce risk.
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This section aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle and ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption to protect stored data.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission.
2. **PKI Implementation**: Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing digital certificates.
3. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow all GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This section establishes a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
This policy covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
1. **SIEM Deployment**: Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized logging of security events.
2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats.
3. **Investigative Protocols**: Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access to necessary personnel.
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
There are no exceptions; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document all lessons learned for future reference.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This section outlines security measures for cloud storage to protect sensitive data.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using strong encryption methods.
2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access cloud data.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure all cloud storage practices comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the outlined security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly.
