# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our organization’s assets. Strong authentication enhances security and builds trust with clients and partners.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA. 
   - Users must provide at least two forms of verification, such as a password and a mobile authentication app.

2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters. 
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords must be changed every three months.
   - Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - For high-security access, biometric methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition must be implemented.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Define uptime expectations for identity providers to ensure reliable access.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. This approach enhances security and protects sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Access decisions must be based on user roles. 
   - Regularly review roles to ensure they align with current job functions.

2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. 
   - Ensure that only authorized personnel can access this host.

3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on data sensitivity. 
   - Implement strict access controls between segments.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: 
   - Monitor all devices connected to the network for unusual activity. 
   - Use automated tools to alert the security team of potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for further details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Protecting data ensures compliance and builds customer trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. 
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates. 
   - Regularly update and audit certificates to maintain security.

3. **Compliance with GDPR**: 
   - Follow GDPR guidelines for data handling and processing. 
   - Ensure that all data collection practices are transparent and lawful.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a rapid response plan for security incidents. Quick action minimizes damage and protects the organization’s reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. 
   - Regularly review logs for signs of suspicious activity.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. 
   - Use findings to improve overall security posture.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: 
   - During investigations, ensure that personnel have only the access necessary to perform their tasks. 
   - Regularly review access rights.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence. 
   - Ensure that forensic systems are isolated from the main network.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned to improve future responses.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud. Protecting cloud data is essential for compliance and customer trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using strong encryption methods. 
   - Regularly review encryption standards to ensure they meet industry best practices.

2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement strict access controls for cloud storage. 
   - Use RBAC to limit access based on user roles.

3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure that cloud storage practices comply with relevant regulations, such as GDPR. 
   - Regularly audit cloud storage for compliance.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.

## Glossary

- **Zero Trust**: A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources.
