# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security through robust authentication methods. By implementing strong authentication, we protect our assets and ensure trust in our systems.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All critical systems must use MFA. This includes a combination of something you know (password), something you have (token), and something you are (biometric).
   
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length: 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Historical password tracking: Users cannot reuse the last five passwords.
   - Passwords must be rotated every three months.

3. **Identity Federation**: 
   - Implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications to streamline access.
   - Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems.
   - Require biometric verification for high-security access.
   - Define Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation to management after three incidents within six months.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on restricting network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all devices connected to our network.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Access should be granted based on the user's role within the organization.
   
2. **Bastion Host**: Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to enhance security. This host acts as a gateway, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas.

3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. This limits access to sensitive data and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

4. **Monitoring**: Use Endpoint Telemetry to monitor all devices connected to the network. This helps in identifying potential threats in real-time.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review is required. See Section 1 for more details on access control.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to the security team after two incidents.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring data security, we maintain compliance with SOC2 requirements and build trust with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption to protect stored data.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Implement PKI for managing digital certificates. This ensures secure communications and data integrity.

3. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data and ensure privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $2,000, with escalation to legal after two incidents.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective response, we protect our organization’s reputation and assets.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. These systems lure attackers, providing valuable insights into their methods.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. Only authorized personnel should have access to sensitive information.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure that compromised systems are isolated from the network.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented and shared with relevant stakeholders. Penalties for failure to comply may include fines of up to $1,500, with escalation to the security team after one incident.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. This protects data from unauthorized access.

2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access cloud storage. Use RBAC to manage permissions effectively.

3. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2. Regularly review cloud storage practices to maintain compliance.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage solutions must adhere to this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with cloud storage security measures. Non-compliance may result in fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to the IT department after two incidents.
