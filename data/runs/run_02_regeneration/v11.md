# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security through robust authentication methods. By implementing strong authentication, we protect our assets and improve overall business resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All critical systems must use MFA. This includes a combination of something you know (password), something you have (token), and something you are (biometric).
   
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
   - Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Biometric Verification**: For high-security access, biometric verification is mandatory. This adds an additional layer of security.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: Define an SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure availability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation to management after three violations within a six-month period.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to ensure that only authorized personnel can access our network. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we enhance security and protect sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all devices connected to our network.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC for all access decisions. This ensures that users have access only to the information necessary for their roles.

2. **Bastion Host**: Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. This adds a layer of security by isolating administrative tasks.

3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. This limits access to sensitive data and reduces risk.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: Monitor all devices connected to the network using Endpoint Telemetry. This helps in identifying potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review is required. See Section 1 for more details on access control.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to the security team after two incidents.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy is designed to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring data security, we comply with regulations and build trust with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. This protects stored data from unauthorized access.
   
2. **Data In Transit**: Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. This secures data as it moves across networks.

3. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Implement PKI for managing digital certificates. This ensures secure communications.

4. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $2,000, with a review process initiated after one incident.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response to security incidents. By minimizing damage, we protect our organization and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. This helps in understanding attack patterns.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. This limits access to only what is necessary.

4. **Air Gap**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis of compromised systems. This isolates affected systems from the network.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented and shared. Penalties for failure to comply may include fines of up to $1,500, with escalation to the security team after one incident.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure data stored in the cloud. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using AES-256. This protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.

2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to cloud storage. Use RBAC to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

3. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2. Regular audits will be conducted to verify compliance.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the security requirements outlined in this policy.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will result in penalties of up to $1,000. Escalation to management will occur after two violations within a year.
