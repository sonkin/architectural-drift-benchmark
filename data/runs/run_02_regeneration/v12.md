# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. We will implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be defined for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must also be documented and reviewed annually. 

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties for non-compliance will be determined based on the severity of the violation, with escalation timelines established for each case.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions will be governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Administrative access must be conducted through a Bastion Host to ensure secure management. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and monitoring will be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect any unauthorized access.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted but will require a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties applied based on the nature of the breach.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy is designed to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust and reliability with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
All sensitive data must be encrypted when at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) will be implemented for certificate management, and all data handling must comply with GDPR regulations.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. A swift response protects our assets and maintains business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system will be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege must be followed to limit access to necessary personnel only. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions will be made; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned must be documented. Penalties for non-compliance will be determined based on the severity of the incident, with specific escalation timelines established.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and compliance with industry standards. By protecting our cloud assets, we enhance operational efficiency and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions utilized by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular compliance checks will be conducted to ensure adherence to relevant regulations.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage solutions must comply with this policy.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored continuously, with penalties for violations determined based on the severity of the breach.
