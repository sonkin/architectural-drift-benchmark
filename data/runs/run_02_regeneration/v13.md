# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security through robust authentication methods. By implementing strong authentication, we protect our assets and ensure trust in our systems, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. All corporate applications must support OIDC for modern systems and SAML for legacy systems. A defined SLA for identity provider uptime is essential to maintain operational efficiency. 

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which should also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties starting at $500 for the first offense and escalating to $2,000 for subsequent offenses. All incidents will be escalated within 48 hours for review.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This policy restricts network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our security posture and protecting our data.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions must be governed by RBAC, ensuring that users have only the permissions necessary for their roles. Administrative access should be conducted through a Bastion Host to minimize exposure. Networks must be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and all access must be monitored using Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties starting at $1,000 for first-time offenders and escalating to $5,000 for repeat violations.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements, we enhance our reputation and build trust with clients and stakeholders.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
All sensitive data must be encrypted when stored (Data At Rest) using AES-256 encryption. Data In Transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. PKI should be implemented for effective certificate management, and all data handling must comply with GDPR regulations.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO, with penalties starting at $1,500 for first offenses and increasing to $7,500 for repeated violations.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis, we protect our organization and maintain operational integrity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
A SIEM must be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems should be maintained to detect threats proactively. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege must be followed to limit access. Forensic analysis should utilize an Air Gap to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, with lessons learned documented for future reference. Penalties for non-compliance will start at $2,000 and escalate to $10,000 for repeated failures to follow the incident response process.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy ensures the security of data stored in the cloud. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and enhance our competitive advantage.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR, must be maintained at all times.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but must be documented and reviewed quarterly.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored through regular audits. Non-compliance will result in penalties starting at $1,000 and escalating to $5,000 for repeated violations.
