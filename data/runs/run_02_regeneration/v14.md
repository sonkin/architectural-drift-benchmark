# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. Additionally, we will define a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability. 

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. 

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties assessed based on the severity of the breach. The escalation timeline for addressing violations will be within 48 hours of detection.

## Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on restricting network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions will be governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Administrative access must be conducted through a Bastion Host to minimize exposure. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and monitoring will be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted but will require a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties applied based on the nature of the breach.

## Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust and credibility with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Data At Rest must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption standards. Data In Transit should be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. We will implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for certificate management and adhere to GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action.

---

## Incident Response

### Purpose
This section establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective response strategies, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system will be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege will be followed to limit access. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions will be made; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned will be documented to improve future responses. Penalties for non-compliance will be assessed based on the severity of the incident, with a timeline for escalation set at 72 hours.

## Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and compliance. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and enhance operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, must be maintained to protect sensitive information.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage solutions must adhere to the established security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will result in penalties, with escalation timelines set at 48 hours for corrective actions.
