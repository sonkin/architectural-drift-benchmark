# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. Additionally, passwords must have a minimum length of 12 characters and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. For example, if a legacy application cannot support MFA, it must be documented and reviewed monthly to ensure a plan for future compliance is in place.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties including a potential fine of $500 for non-compliance. Escalation will occur within 48 hours of the violation being identified.

## Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on restricting network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, thereby enhancing our security framework.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions must be governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring that users have access only to the resources necessary for their roles. Administrative access should be conducted through a Bastion Host, which serves as a secure gateway. Networks must be segmented based on sensitivity levels to minimize risk. Continuous monitoring should be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect any unauthorized access attempts.

### Exceptions
In emergency situations, access may be granted with a post-incident review. For instance, if a critical system fails, temporary access may be allowed, but it must be documented and reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for further details on authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to ensure compliance. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties for violations potentially reaching $1,000, depending on the severity of the breach.

## Data Protection

### Purpose
This section aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
All sensitive data must be encrypted when at rest using AES-256 encryption standards. Additionally, data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) must be implemented for managing digital certificates. Compliance with GDPR data handling requirements is mandatory to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
In test environments, relaxed encryption standards may be permitted. However, production data must never be stored in test environments to prevent exposure.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), with potential penalties of up to $2,000 for serious breaches.

## Incident Response

### Purpose
This section establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. A swift response not only protects our assets but also preserves our reputation and customer trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems should be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege must be followed, ensuring that personnel have only the access necessary to perform their duties. Forensic analysis should utilize an Air Gap to prevent contamination of evidence.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, with lessons learned documented for future reference. Penalties for failure to comply with incident response protocols may reach $3,000, depending on the impact of the incident.

## Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This section outlines the security measures for cloud storage, ensuring that our data remains secure and compliant. By implementing strong security practices, we can leverage cloud technology while protecting our assets.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions utilized by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits must be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects requiring relaxed security measures, but these must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored through regular audits, with penalties for violations potentially reaching $1,500.
