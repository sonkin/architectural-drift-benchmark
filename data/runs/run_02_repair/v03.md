# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Password Policy

### Purpose
This policy sets rules for creating secure passwords. It protects company information and ensures passwords are strong and tracked.

### Scope
This applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems that need a password.

### Directives
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in passwords. Change passwords every three months. Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt. Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for the last five changes. Ensure passwords protect Data At Rest.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. Document these exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This policy limits network access to authorized users. It supports a Zero Trust approach to security.

### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for admin access. Separate networks based on sensitivity. Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry. Ensure protection for Data In Transit.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to keep sensitive data safe. It ensures we follow SOC2 rules.

### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data and higher classifications.

### Directives
Encrypt data stored on devices using AES-256. Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3. Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates. Follow GDPR rules for handling data.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy outlines how to respond quickly to security issues. It aims to reduce damage using the Kill Chain method.

### Scope
This applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging. Keep Honeypot systems to detect threats. Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Identity Federation

### Purpose
This policy allows secure single sign-on. It helps reduce password fatigue for users.

### Scope
This applies to all company applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications. Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document and review these annually.

### Enforcement
Monitor federation logs for any unusual activity. Alerts will be triggered for anomalies.

---

## 6. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy ensures data is stored securely in the cloud. It protects against unauthorized access.

### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the company.

### Directives
Encrypt data stored in the cloud using AES-256. Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3. Implement strict access controls. Regularly check compliance with relevant laws.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud storage access logs monthly. Report any non-compliance to the security team.
