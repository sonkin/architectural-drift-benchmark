# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
This policy sets rules for creating secure passwords and allows secure single sign-on. It protects company information and reduces password fatigue for users.

### Scope
This applies to all employees, contractors, and company applications. It covers all systems that need a password and external partner systems.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Longer passwords are harder to crack and provide better security.
3. **Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in passwords.** This complexity makes passwords more resistant to attacks.
4. **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to ensure timely updates and maintain security.
5. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing, enhancing security.
6. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for the last five changes.** Maintain a secure log of previous passwords to enforce this rule.
7. **Ensure passwords protect Data At Rest.** Use encryption to safeguard stored data from unauthorized access.
8. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications.
9. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** Implement SAML to facilitate single sign-on for legacy applications.
10. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** Use fingerprint or facial recognition to enhance security for sensitive areas.
11. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain high availability to prevent access issues.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document these exceptions and review them annually.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity. Repeated violations may lead to losing access. Alerts will be triggered for anomalies.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This policy limits network access to authorized users. It supports a Zero Trust approach to security.

### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for admin access.** This secure server acts as a gateway for administrative tasks, reducing exposure.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Collect and analyze data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior.
5. **Ensure protection for Data In Transit.** Use encryption protocols to secure data being transmitted across the network.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to keep sensitive data safe. It ensures we follow SOC2 rules.

### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data and higher classifications.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored on devices using AES-256.** This encryption standard provides strong protection for sensitive information.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** This protocol secures data in transit, preventing interception by unauthorized parties.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** PKI enables secure communication by managing digital certificates and encryption keys.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for handling data.** Ensure compliance with data protection regulations to safeguard personal information.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy outlines how to respond quickly to security issues. It aims to reduce damage using the Kill Chain method.

### Scope
This applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data for effective monitoring.
2. **Keep Honeypot systems to detect threats.** Deploy decoy systems to lure attackers and gather intelligence on their methods.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Limit access to only those who need it to minimize risk during incident response.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise during investigations.

### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy ensures data is stored securely in the cloud. It protects against unauthorized access.

### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the company.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored in the cloud using AES-256.** This encryption standard protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** This protocol secures data in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
3. **Implement strict access controls.** Define user permissions and roles to limit access to sensitive data.
4. **Regularly check compliance with relevant laws.** Conduct audits to ensure adherence to legal and regulatory requirements.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Review cloud storage access logs monthly. Report any non-compliance to the security team.
