# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security Policies

### 1.1 Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy empowers our workforce by establishing secure password practices. It enhances productivity through secure single sign-on and protects valuable company information. See Section 2.1 for definitions.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees, contractors, and company applications. It covers all systems that need a password and external partner systems. See Section 1.2 for related policies.

#### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Longer passwords are harder to crack and provide better security.
3. **Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in passwords.** This complexity makes passwords more resistant to attacks.
4. **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to ensure timely updates and maintain security.
5. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing, enhancing security.
6. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for the last five changes.** Maintain a secure log of previous passwords to enforce this rule.
7. **Ensure passwords protect Data At Rest.** Use encryption to safeguard stored data from unauthorized access.
8. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications.
9. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** Implement SAML to facilitate single sign-on for legacy applications.
10. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** Use fingerprint or facial recognition to enhance security for sensitive areas.
11. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain high availability to prevent access issues.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document these exceptions and review them annually. See Section 1.2 for related exceptions.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time offenders will face a warning and a $100 fine. Repeat violations within six months will result in a $500 fine. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for up to 30 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further review. See Section 1.2 for enforcement details.

### 1.2 Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our security posture by limiting network access to authorized users. It supports a Zero Trust approach, maximizing our investment in cybersecurity. See Section 2.1 for related terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for admin access.** This secure server acts as a gateway for administrative tasks, reducing exposure.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Collect and analyze data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior.
5. **Ensure protection for Data In Transit.** Use encryption protocols to secure data being transmitted across the network.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.1 for more details.

#### Enforcement
Unauthorized access will result in penalties. First offenses will incur a $200 fine and a warning. Repeat offenses within a year will lead to a $1,000 fine and a review of access privileges. Serious breaches may result in immediate suspension of access for 60 days. All cases will be escalated to the security team for investigation. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.

### 1.3 Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards sensitive data, ensuring compliance with SOC2 rules. Protecting our data enhances trust and drives business success. See Section 2.1 for relevant terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data and higher classifications. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored on devices using AES-256.** This encryption standard provides strong protection for sensitive information.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** This protocol secures data in transit, preventing interception by unauthorized parties.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** PKI enables secure communication by managing digital certificates and encryption keys.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for handling data.** Ensure compliance with data protection regulations to safeguard personal information.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests. See Section 1.1 for related exceptions.

#### Enforcement
Non-compliance with data protection measures will incur penalties. First violations will result in a $300 fine and mandatory training. Repeat violations within six months will lead to a $1,500 fine and potential suspension of access. Serious breaches may result in termination of employment. All incidents will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for review. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.

### 1.4 Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines a proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our business interests using the Kill Chain method. See Section 2.1 for related terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the response. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data for effective monitoring.
2. **Keep Honeypot systems to detect threats.** Deploy decoy systems to lure attackers and gather intelligence on their methods.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Limit access to only those who need it to minimize risk during incident response.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise during investigations.

#### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Enforcement
Failure to follow incident response protocols will incur penalties. First offenses will result in a $400 fine and mandatory retraining. Repeat offenses within a year will lead to a $2,000 fine and possible suspension of duties. Serious violations may result in termination. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further action. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.

### 1.5 Cloud Storage Security

#### Purpose
This policy ensures secure cloud data storage, protecting against unauthorized access. It enhances our operational efficiency and supports business continuity. See Section 2.1 for relevant terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the company. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored in the cloud using AES-256.** This encryption standard protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** This protocol secures data in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
3. **Implement strict access controls.** Define user permissions and roles to limit access to sensitive data.
4. **Regularly check compliance with relevant laws.** Conduct audits to ensure adherence to legal and regulatory requirements.

#### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions. See Section 1.1 for related exceptions.

#### Enforcement
Violations of cloud storage security will incur penalties. First offenses will result in a $500 fine and a warning. Repeat offenses within six months will lead to a $2,500 fine and a review of access privileges. Serious breaches may result in immediate suspension of access for 90 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for investigation. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.
