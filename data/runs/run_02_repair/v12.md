# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security Policies

### 1.1 Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy empowers our workforce by establishing secure password practices. It enhances productivity through secure single sign-on and protects valuable company information. See Section 2.1 for definitions.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees, contractors, and company applications. It covers all systems that need a password and external partner systems. See Section 1.2 for related policies.

#### Directives
All users must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems, requiring two or more verification factors to gain access. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, as longer passwords are harder to crack. Users should include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in passwords, as this complexity makes passwords more resistant to attacks. Passwords must be changed every three months, and users should set reminders to ensure timely updates. Passwords must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt, which adds random data to passwords before hashing. Users must keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for the last five changes. Passwords must ensure protection for Data At Rest by using encryption to safeguard stored data. OpenID Connect (OIDC) should be used for modern applications, allowing secure authentication and authorization. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) must be supported for older systems to facilitate single sign-on. Biometric verification is required for high-security access, using fingerprint or facial recognition. Service Level Agreements (SLA) must be set for identity provider uptime, ensuring high availability to prevent access issues.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document these exceptions and review them annually. See Section 1.2 for related exceptions.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time offenders will face a warning and a $100 fine. Repeat violations within six months will result in a $500 fine. Continued non-compliance may lead to suspension of access for up to 30 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further review. See Section 1.2 for enforcement details.

### 1.2 Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our security posture by limiting network access to authorized users. It supports a Zero Trust approach, maximizing our investment in cybersecurity. See Section 2.1 for related terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be used for all access decisions, assigning permissions based on user roles. A Bastion Host should be used for admin access, acting as a secure gateway for administrative tasks. Networks must be separated based on sensitivity, creating distinct segments to protect sensitive data. Activity must be monitored with Endpoint Telemetry, collecting and analyzing data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior. Protection for Data In Transit must be ensured by using encryption protocols to secure data being transmitted.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.1 for more details.

#### Enforcement
Unauthorized access will result in penalties. First offenses will incur a $200 fine and a warning. Repeat offenses within a year will lead to a $1,000 fine and a review of access privileges. Serious breaches may result in immediate suspension of access for 60 days. All cases will be escalated to the security team for investigation. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.

### 1.3 Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards sensitive data, ensuring compliance with SOC2 rules. Protecting our data enhances trust and drives business success. See Section 2.1 for relevant terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data and higher classifications. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
Data stored on devices must be encrypted using AES-256, as this encryption standard provides strong protection. Data being sent must be encrypted using TLS 1.3, securing data in transit and preventing interception. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) must be used for managing certificates, enabling secure communication. GDPR rules for handling data must be followed to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests. See Section 1.1 for related exceptions.

#### Enforcement
Non-compliance with data protection measures will incur penalties. First violations will result in a $300 fine and mandatory training. Repeat violations within six months will lead to a $1,500 fine and potential suspension of access. Serious breaches may result in termination of employment. All incidents will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for review. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.

### 1.4 Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines a proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our business interests using the Kill Chain method. See Section 2.1 for related terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the response. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must be used for logging, collecting and analyzing security data. Honeypot systems should be kept to detect threats, deploying decoy systems to lure attackers. The Least Privilege principle must be followed during investigations, limiting access to only those who need it. An Air Gap must be used for forensic analysis, isolating affected systems from the network.

#### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Enforcement
Failure to follow incident response protocols will incur penalties. First offenses will result in a $400 fine and mandatory retraining. Repeat offenses within a year will lead to a $2,000 fine and possible suspension of duties. Serious violations may result in termination. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for further action. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.

### 1.5 Cloud Storage Security

#### Purpose
This policy ensures secure cloud data storage, protecting against unauthorized access. It enhances our operational efficiency and supports business continuity. See Section 2.1 for relevant terms.

#### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the company. See Section 1.1 for related policies.

#### Directives
Data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using AES-256, as this encryption standard protects sensitive information. Data being sent must be encrypted using TLS 1.3, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. Strict access controls must be implemented, defining user permissions and roles. Regular checks for compliance with relevant laws must be conducted.

#### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions. See Section 1.1 for related exceptions.

#### Enforcement
Violations of cloud storage security will incur penalties. First offenses will result in a $500 fine and a warning. Repeat offenses within six months will lead to a $2,500 fine and a review of access privileges. Serious breaches may result in immediate suspension of access for 90 days. All incidents will be escalated to the security team for investigation. See Section 1.1 for enforcement details.
