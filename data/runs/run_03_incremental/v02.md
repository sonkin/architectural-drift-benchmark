## 1. Password Policy

### Purpose
Define secure authentication standards. Protect organizational assets.

### Scope
All employees and contractors. All systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. Rotate passwords quarterly. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Maintain a history of the last 5 passwords to prevent reuse.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions. Review monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel. Implement Zero Trust architecture.

### Scope
All network infrastructure. All connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements.

### Scope
All data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data never in test.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits. Non-compliance escalated to CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish rapid response to security incidents. Minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
All security events. All personnel involved in response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews mandatory. Lessons learned documented.

## 5. Identity Federation

### Purpose
Enable secure single sign-on capabilities. Reduce password fatigue.

### Scope
All corporate applications. External partner integrations.

### Directives
Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Federation logs monitored. Anomalies trigger alerts.

## 6. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in cloud environments. Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Scope
All data stored in cloud services. All personnel with access to cloud storage.

### Directives
Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.3, respectively. Implement strict access controls using RBAC. Regularly review and update access permissions. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Conduct regular security assessments of cloud service providers.

### Exceptions
Temporary access for third-party vendors may be granted with documented approval. Review access quarterly.

### Enforcement
Monthly audits of cloud storage access logs. Non-compliance reported to the CISO.
