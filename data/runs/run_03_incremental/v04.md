# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Set clear rules for creating secure passwords and enable secure single sign-on for easier access. Keep our organization's information safe and reduce the burden of remembering multiple passwords.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems that require a password, including all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems. Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. Change passwords every three months. Store passwords securely. Keep a record of the last 5 passwords to avoid using them again. Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications. Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems. Require biometric verification for high-security access. Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Older systems can use simpler password methods for a limited time. Isolated systems can use local login methods. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated issues may lead to losing access. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized individuals. Use a Zero Trust approach to security.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions. Use a secure server for administrative tasks. Separate networks based on sensitivity. Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive information throughout its lifecycle. Ensure we meet SOC2 compliance standards.

### Scope
Includes all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Protect stored data with strong encryption. Secure data in transit with the latest encryption methods. Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates. Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.

### Exceptions
Testing environments can have relaxed security measures, but production data must never be in these environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a quick response plan for security incidents. Reduce damage by analyzing the situation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Use a centralized logging system for monitoring. Maintain systems to detect threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use isolated systems for detailed analysis.

### Exceptions
None. Every incident must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the safety of data stored in cloud services. Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Scope
Covers all data stored in cloud services and all personnel with access to this data.

### Directives
Encrypt data both when stored and when being transferred. Use strict access controls to limit who can view or edit data. Regularly review and update who has access. Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA. Conduct regular security checks on cloud service providers.

### Exceptions
Temporary access for third-party vendors can be granted with proper documentation. Review this access every three months.

### Enforcement
Conduct monthly audits of cloud storage access logs. Report any non-compliance to the CISO.
