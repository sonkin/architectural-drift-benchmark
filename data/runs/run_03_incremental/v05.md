# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Set clear rules for creating secure passwords and enable secure single sign-on for easier access. Keep our organization's information safe and reduce the burden of remembering multiple passwords.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems that require a password, including all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification).
   
2. **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** When creating a password, ensure that it meets these criteria by using a combination of different character types and avoiding easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

3. **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to update passwords regularly, and ensure that the new password is different from the previous five passwords to enhance security.

4. **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a password manager to keep passwords encrypted and easily accessible, ensuring that they are not written down or stored in an insecure manner.

5. **Keep a record of the last 5 passwords to avoid using them again.** Maintain a secure log of previous passwords to prevent reuse, which can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

6. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** Implement OIDC as a standard for authentication, allowing users to log in using their existing accounts from trusted identity providers.

7. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** Ensure that legacy systems are compatible with SAML to facilitate secure single sign-on capabilities.

8. **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, for systems that handle sensitive information.

9. **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear expectations for the availability of identity services, ensuring that they are reliable and accessible when needed.

### Exceptions
Older systems can use simpler password methods for a limited time. Isolated systems can use local login methods. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated issues may lead to losing access. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized individuals. Use a Zero Trust approach to security.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on the roles of users within the organization, ensuring that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions.

2. **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure that administrative functions are performed on dedicated, secure servers that are isolated from general user access to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes.

3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible through secure channels.

4. **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor devices connected to the network for any suspicious activity or potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive information throughout its lifecycle. Ensure we meet SOC2 compliance standards.

### Scope
Includes all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Protect stored data with strong encryption.** Utilize encryption algorithms that meet industry standards to secure data at rest, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access it without the appropriate decryption keys.

2. **Secure data in transit with the latest encryption methods.** Implement protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data being transmitted over networks, protecting it from interception during transfer.

3. **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Establish a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization.

4. **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR regulations, including obtaining consent from individuals and providing them with rights regarding their personal data.

### Exceptions
Testing environments can have relaxed security measures, but production data must never be in these environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a quick response plan for security incidents. Reduce damage by analyzing the situation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Use a centralized logging system for monitoring.** Implement a logging solution that aggregates logs from various sources, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events.

2. **Maintain systems to detect threats.** Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to identify and respond to potential threats in real-time.

3. **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that only personnel with a legitimate need have access to sensitive information during incident investigations, minimizing the risk of further exposure.

4. **Use isolated systems for detailed analysis.** Conduct forensic analysis on isolated systems to prevent contamination of live environments and to ensure the integrity of the investigation.

### Exceptions
None. Every incident must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the safety of data stored in cloud services. Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Scope
Covers all data stored in cloud services and all personnel with access to this data.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data both when stored and when being transferred.** Implement encryption protocols to protect data at rest in cloud storage and during transmission to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Use strict access controls to limit who can view or edit data.** Establish access control policies that define who can access specific data sets, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the ability to view or modify sensitive information.

3. **Regularly review and update who has access.** Conduct periodic reviews of access permissions to ensure that only current employees and authorized personnel have access to sensitive data, revoking access for those who no longer require it.

4. **Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA.** Regularly assess cloud storage practices to ensure they align with legal requirements, implementing necessary changes to maintain compliance.

5. **Conduct regular security checks on cloud service providers.** Evaluate the security measures and compliance status of cloud service providers to ensure they meet organizational security standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary access for third-party vendors can be granted with proper documentation. Review this access every three months.

### Enforcement
Conduct monthly audits of cloud storage access logs. Report any non-compliance to the CISO.
