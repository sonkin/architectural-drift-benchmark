# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Establish robust authentication practices to enhance security and streamline user access. By implementing secure password protocols and single sign-on solutions, we not only protect our organization's valuable information but also improve employee productivity and satisfaction through simplified access.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems that require a password, including all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification).
  
- **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** When creating a password, ensure that it meets these criteria by using a combination of different character types and avoiding easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

- **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to update passwords regularly, and ensure that the new password is different from the previous five passwords to enhance security.

- **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a password manager to keep passwords encrypted and easily accessible, ensuring that they are not written down or stored in an insecure manner.

- **Keep a record of the last 5 passwords to avoid using them again.** Maintain a secure log of previous passwords to prevent reuse, which can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** Implement OIDC as a standard for authentication, allowing users to log in using their existing accounts from trusted identity providers.

- **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** Ensure that legacy systems are compatible with SAML to facilitate secure single sign-on capabilities.

- **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, for systems that handle sensitive information.

- **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear expectations for the availability of identity services, ensuring that they are reliable and accessible when needed.

### Exceptions
Older systems can use simpler password methods for a limited time. Isolated systems can use local login methods. Document any exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated issues may lead to losing access. Monitor federation logs for unusual activity. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Implement a strategic approach to network access that prioritizes security while maximizing operational efficiency. By adopting a Zero Trust model, we ensure that only authorized individuals can access our network, thereby safeguarding our assets and enhancing overall business resilience.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
- **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on the roles of users within the organization, ensuring that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions.

- **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure that administrative functions are performed on dedicated, secure servers that are isolated from general user access to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes.

- **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible through secure channels.

- **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor devices connected to the network for any suspicious activity or potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information throughout its lifecycle, aligning with our commitment to excellence and compliance. By safeguarding our data, we not only protect our reputation but also enhance customer trust and drive business growth.

### Scope
Includes all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
- **Protect stored data with strong encryption.** Utilize encryption algorithms that meet industry standards to secure data at rest, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access it without the appropriate decryption keys.

- **Secure data in transit with the latest encryption methods.** Implement protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data being transmitted over networks, protecting it from interception during transfer.

- **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Establish a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization.

- **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR regulations, including obtaining consent from individuals and providing them with rights regarding their personal data.

### Exceptions
Testing environments can have relaxed security measures, but production data must never be in these environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Develop a proactive incident response strategy that minimizes damage and enhances our organizational resilience. By effectively managing security incidents, we protect our assets and maintain stakeholder confidence, ultimately supporting our business objectives.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
- **Use a centralized logging system for monitoring.** Implement a logging solution that aggregates logs from various sources, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events.

- **Maintain systems to detect threats.** Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to identify and respond to potential threats in real-time.

- **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that only personnel with a legitimate need have access to sensitive information during incident investigations, minimizing the risk of further exposure.

- **Use isolated systems for detailed analysis.** Conduct forensic analysis on isolated systems to prevent contamination of live environments and to ensure the integrity of the investigation.

### Exceptions
None. Every incident must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Safeguard our data in cloud environments to ensure business continuity and protect against unauthorized access. By securing our cloud storage, we not only mitigate risks but also leverage cloud technologies to drive innovation and efficiency.

### Scope
Covers all data stored in cloud services and all personnel with access to this data.

### Directives
- **Encrypt data both when stored and when being transferred.** Implement encryption protocols to protect data at rest in cloud storage and during transmission to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Use strict access controls to limit who can view or edit data.** Establish access control policies that define who can access specific data sets, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the ability to view or modify sensitive information.

- **Regularly review and update who has access.** Conduct periodic reviews of access permissions to ensure that only current employees and authorized personnel have access to sensitive data, revoking access for those who no longer require it.

- **Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA.** Regularly assess cloud storage practices to ensure they align with legal requirements, implementing necessary changes to maintain compliance.

- **Conduct regular security checks on cloud service providers.** Evaluate the security measures and compliance status of cloud service providers to ensure they meet organizational security standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary access for third-party vendors can be granted with proper documentation. Review this access every three months.

### Enforcement
Conduct monthly audits of cloud storage access logs. Report any non-compliance to the CISO.
