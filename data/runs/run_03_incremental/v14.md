# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## IT Department

### Purpose
Establish robust authentication practices, network access control, data protection, incident response, and cloud storage security to enhance security and streamline user access. By implementing secure protocols and practices, we protect our organization's valuable information and improve operational efficiency. **Remember, adopting a Zero Trust approach is essential, where no user or device is trusted by default, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a critical component of our security strategy.**

### Scope
Applies to all systems, data, and personnel involved in IT operations.

### Directives

#### Authentication
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for important systems, which involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system. These factors may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification). Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. When creating a password, users must ensure that it meets these criteria by using a combination of different character types and avoiding easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words. Passwords must be changed every three months, with reminders set to update them regularly. The new password should be different from the previous five passwords to enhance security. Passwords must be stored securely, utilizing a password manager to keep them encrypted and easily accessible, ensuring that they are not written down or stored in an insecure manner. Users should keep a record of the last five passwords to avoid using them again, maintaining a secure log of previous passwords to prevent reuse, which can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. OpenID Connect (OIDC) should be used for modern applications, implementing OIDC as a standard for authentication, allowing users to log in using their existing accounts from trusted identity providers. For older systems, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) must be supported to ensure that legacy systems are compatible with SAML to facilitate secure single sign-on capabilities. Biometric verification is required for high-security access, implementing biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, for systems that handle sensitive information. Service level agreements (SLA) should be set for identity provider uptime, establishing clear expectations for the availability of identity services, ensuring that they are reliable and accessible when needed. **Always remember to apply the Zero Trust model and utilize MFA to enhance security further.**

#### Network Access Control
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be used for all access decisions, assigning permissions based on the roles of users within the organization to ensure that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions. A secure server should be used for administrative tasks, ensuring that administrative functions are performed on dedicated, secure servers that are isolated from general user access to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes. Networks must be separated based on sensitivity, creating distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible through secure channels. Activity should be monitored with endpoint tracking, implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor devices connected to the network for any suspicious activity or potential threats. **Incorporate Zero Trust principles and ensure MFA is enforced for all network access.**

#### Data Protection
Stored data must be protected with strong encryption, utilizing encryption algorithms that meet industry standards to secure data at rest, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access it without the appropriate decryption keys. Data in transit should be secured with the latest encryption methods, implementing protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data being transmitted over networks, protecting it from interception during transfer. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) should be used for managing certificates, establishing a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization. Regular security checks on cloud service providers must be conducted, evaluating the security measures and compliance status of cloud service providers to ensure they meet organizational security standards. **Always apply Zero Trust principles and ensure that MFA is utilized to protect sensitive data effectively.**

#### Incident Response
A centralized logging system for monitoring must be used, implementing a logging solution that aggregates logs from various sources, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events. Systems should be maintained to detect threats, utilizing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to identify and respond to potential threats in real-time. The principle of Least Privilege must be followed during investigations, ensuring that only personnel with a legitimate need have access to sensitive information during incident investigations, minimizing the risk of further exposure. Isolated systems should be used for detailed analysis, conducting forensic analysis on isolated systems to prevent contamination of live environments and to ensure the integrity of the investigation. **Incorporate Zero Trust methodologies and ensure MFA is part of the incident response strategy.**

#### Cloud Storage Security
Data must be encrypted both when stored and when being transferred, implementing encryption protocols to protect data at rest in cloud storage and during transmission to prevent unauthorized access. Strict access controls should be used to limit who can view or edit data, establishing access control policies that define who can access specific data sets, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the ability to view or modify sensitive information. Regular reviews and updates of who has access must be conducted, periodically reviewing access permissions to ensure that only current employees and authorized personnel have access to sensitive data, revoking access for those who no longer require it. Compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA must be ensured, regularly assessing cloud storage practices to ensure they align with legal requirements and implementing necessary changes to maintain compliance. **Always apply Zero Trust principles and enforce MFA for all cloud storage access.**

### Exceptions
Older systems can use simpler password methods for a limited time. Isolated systems can use local login methods. Any exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. Testing environments can have relaxed security measures, but production data must never be in these environments. Temporary access for third-party vendors can be granted with proper documentation, and this access must be reviewed every three months. **Even in exceptions, consider Zero Trust principles and MFA where feasible.**

### Enforcement
Any violations must be reported to the security team. For first-time violations, a warning will be issued, and the individual will be required to complete a cybersecurity training session within 30 days. A second violation will result in a fine of $500 and a mandatory review of access privileges, which must be completed within 15 days. A third violation will incur a fine of $1,000, and the individual will face a suspension of access for a period of 30 days, pending a review by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Continuous non-compliance may lead to termination of employment or contract, with a review process initiated within 7 days of the final violation. Federation logs must be monitored for unusual activity, and any anomalies will trigger alerts. Access logs should be checked weekly, and any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation. Audits must be conducted every three months, and any non-compliance must be reported to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Monthly audits of cloud storage access logs must be conducted, and lessons learned should be documented. **Reinforce the importance of Zero Trust and MFA during enforcement actions.**
