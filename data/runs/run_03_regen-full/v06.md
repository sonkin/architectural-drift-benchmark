# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our valuable assets. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves overall security posture.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and operational efficiency. Implementing Zero Trust architecture minimizes potential threats.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers investigation.

This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits conducted. Non-compliance escalated to CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage and ensuring business continuity. Effective incident response protects our assets and reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis. Analyze incidents using the Kill Chain framework.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure cloud storage practices to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance. Strong cloud security enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud. Implement access controls based on RBAC principles. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review annually.
