# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance productivity. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves overall security posture.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication. This includes all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
- Use MFA for all critical systems to enhance security.
- Minimum password length: 12 characters with complexity requirements.
- Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Rotate passwords quarterly and track password history for the last five passwords.
- Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt for added protection.
- Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems.
- Require Biometric verification for high-security access.
- Define SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and protecting sensitive information. Implementing Zero Trust architecture minimizes risks and improves compliance.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
- Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure proper permissions.
- Use Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems.
- Segment networks by sensitivity to limit exposure.
- Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry for real-time insights.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with industry standards. Protecting data enhances trust and supports business growth.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
- Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information.
- Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission.
- Implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications.
- Follow GDPR data handling requirements to maintain compliance and protect privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage and ensuring business continuity. A proactive approach enhances resilience and protects assets.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
- Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events.
- Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection and analysis.
- Follow Least Privilege principles during investigations to limit access.
- Use Air Gap for forensic analysis to protect sensitive data.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned to improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud, protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance. Secure cloud storage supports business agility and innovation.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
- Encrypt all data stored in the cloud to protect against unauthorized access.
- Implement access controls to restrict data access based on user roles.
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to security requirements.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage security practices. Non-compliance reported to the CISO for corrective action.
