# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance user experience. This approach maximizes our return on investment and strengthens our security posture.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and history tracking must prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. For corporate applications, implement OIDC for modern systems and SAML for legacy systems. High-security access requires Biometric verification. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document all exceptions and review them annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture enhances our security and reduces risk.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity to minimize exposure. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry for real-time insights.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to ensure compliance and protect our reputation. This commitment enhances customer trust and drives business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Adhere to GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance with regulations.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage and protect our assets. This proactive approach enhances our resilience and operational continuity.

### Scope
This policy covers all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events effectively. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to capture lessons learned and improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect sensitive information and maintain compliance. This strategy supports our growth and innovation in cloud services.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but they must be documented and reviewed.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly.
