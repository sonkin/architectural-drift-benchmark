# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects our valuable assets. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves overall security posture.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. It covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include complexity requirements. Rotate passwords quarterly and track historical passwords. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. High-security access requires Biometric verification. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access to authorized personnel enhances security and protects sensitive information. Implementing Zero Trust architecture minimizes potential threats.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. It applies to all employees and contractors accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure proper permissions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity to limit exposure. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry for real-time insights.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for additional authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. Strong data protection practices enhance our reputation and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. It includes all employees and contractors handling such data.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to safeguard stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be present in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establishing a rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our assets. A well-defined process enhances our resilience against threats.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in incident response. It includes all employees and contractors.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events. Maintain Honeypot systems for proactive threat detection. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to identify lessons learned. Documentation of these lessons will improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and ensures compliance with regulations. Strong security measures enhance trust and reduce potential liabilities.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization. It includes all employees and contractors accessing cloud services.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud to protect against unauthorized access. Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will assess compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO for further action.
