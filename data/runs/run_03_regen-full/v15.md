# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets and enhance operational efficiency. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be rotated quarterly. Historical passwords cannot be reused for at least five cycles. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team within 24 hours. Repeated violations may result in access revocation after a formal review process.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and operational integrity. Implementing Zero Trust architecture minimizes potential attack surfaces.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. Document all emergency access instances. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an immediate investigation, with findings reported within 48 hours.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to ensure compliance and protect organizational reputation. Effective data protection enhances customer trust and operational resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols. Implement PKI for certificate management. Adhere to GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments. Document all exceptions for review.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO within 72 hours for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response framework for security incidents to minimize damage and ensure business continuity. Effective incident response protects assets and enhances resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in incident response activities.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging and monitoring. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to protect sensitive data.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response. Ensure all incidents are logged and reviewed.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory and must be completed within one week. Document lessons learned and implement improvements within 30 days.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect organizational assets and maintain compliance. Secure cloud storage enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using industry-standard encryption methods. Implement strict access controls based on RBAC principles. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but must be documented and reviewed quarterly. Ensure compliance with all security standards during exceptions.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will assess compliance with cloud storage security policies. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO within 72 hours for corrective action.
