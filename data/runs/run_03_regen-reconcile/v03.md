# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Password Policy

### Purpose
Define secure authentication standards. Protect organizational assets and user accounts.

### Scope
All employees and contractors. All systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track historical passwords using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions. Review monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel. Implement Zero Trust architecture for enhanced security.

### Scope
All network infrastructure. All connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor access with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements and regulations.

### Scope
All data classified as sensitive or higher. Applies to all storage and transmission methods.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements strictly.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits conducted. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO for action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish rapid response to security incidents. Minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis techniques.

### Scope
All security events. All personnel involved in incident response activities.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging and monitoring. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege principles during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response process.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented for future reference.

## 5. Identity Federation

### Purpose
Enable secure single sign-on capabilities. Reduce password fatigue for users across systems.

### Scope
All corporate applications. External partner integrations requiring authentication.

### Directives
Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime and reliability.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review annually for compliance.

### Enforcement
Federation logs monitored regularly. Anomalies trigger alerts for immediate investigation.

## 6. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Safeguard data stored in cloud environments. Ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

### Scope
All cloud storage solutions used by the organization. Applies to all employees and contractors.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest and Data In Transit. Use strong access controls and RBAC. Regularly review cloud service provider compliance with security standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions quarterly.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage practices. Non-compliance reported to the security team for action.
