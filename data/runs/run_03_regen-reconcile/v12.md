# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish strong authentication standards to protect assets and enhance user trust. Secure access leads to improved productivity and reduced risk.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and history tracking must prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing Zero Trust architecture enhances security and reduces potential breaches.

### Scope
This section covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels and monitor activity using Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to maintain trust and comply with regulations. Protecting data enhances business reputation and customer confidence.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management and ensure compliance with GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a rapid response framework for security incidents to minimize damage and recover quickly. Effective incident response protects assets and maintains business continuity.

### Scope
This section covers all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned must be documented for future reference.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect organizational assets and maintain compliance. Secure cloud storage enhances operational efficiency and reduces risk.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the established security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO.
