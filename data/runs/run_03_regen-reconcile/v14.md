# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances trust and protects valuable assets. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves overall security posture.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. For high-security access, require Biometric verification.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team may incur penalties of $500 for first offenses. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation within 30 days.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access protects sensitive information and enhances security. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures only authorized personnel access critical resources.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access may result in penalties of $1,000 and trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. Strong data protection enhances the organization's reputation and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. Production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance may incur penalties of $2,000 and escalate to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
A rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects assets. Effective incident response enhances organizational resilience and reduces recovery costs.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Non-compliance may incur penalties of $3,000, and lessons learned must be documented within 14 days.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and enhances operational efficiency. Strong cloud security measures reduce risks and improve compliance with regulations.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256. Implement strict access controls based on RBAC principles. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the directives outlined.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance may incur penalties of $2,500. Violations will be reviewed within 30 days, and corrective actions must be implemented promptly.
