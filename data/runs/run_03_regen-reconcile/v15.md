# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance user experience. Strong authentication increases trust and reduces risks associated with unauthorized access.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse. Store all credentials using Cryptographic Salt for added protection. 

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. For isolated systems, local authentication may be permitted under specific conditions.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team within 24 hours. Repeated violations may result in access revocation after a thorough review.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing Zero Trust architecture enhances security and minimizes potential threats to our network.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels to limit exposure. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. Document all emergency access instances. See Section 1 for additional authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with findings reported to management within 48 hours.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to ensure compliance and protect our reputation. Effective data protection enhances customer trust and drives business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Ensure compliance with GDPR data handling requirements to protect user privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments. Document all exceptions for review.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO within 72 hours for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage and recover quickly. A well-defined incident response enhances resilience and protects our assets.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events effectively. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory and must be completed within one week of the incident. Document lessons learned and share findings with relevant teams.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect sensitive information and maintain compliance. Secure cloud storage enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations and standards to ensure data protection.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects requiring relaxed security measures. Document all exceptions and review them quarterly.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored continuously, with reports generated monthly. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for immediate action.
