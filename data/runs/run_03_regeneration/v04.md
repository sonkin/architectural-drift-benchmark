# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel and implement Zero Trust architecture.

### Scope

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.
