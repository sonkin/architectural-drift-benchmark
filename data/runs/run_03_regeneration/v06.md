# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish strong authentication standards to protect our assets and enhance security. This approach reduces risks and increases trust in our systems.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication.

### Directives
1. **Use MFA**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all critical systems. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
2. **Password Complexity**: Require a minimum password length of 12 characters. Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
3. **Password Rotation**: Rotate passwords every three months to minimize risks from compromised credentials.
4. **Historical Tracking**: Track previous passwords to prevent reuse. Users cannot use their last five passwords.
5. **Store Credentials Securely**: Use Cryptographic Salt to securely store passwords, making them difficult to crack.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document these exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. This approach enhances security and protects sensitive information.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Implement RBAC**: Use Role-Based Access Control for all access decisions. Assign permissions based on user roles.
2. **Use Bastion Host**: Require a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. This adds a secure layer for management tasks.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. This limits exposure of sensitive data.
4. **Monitor Access**: Use Endpoint Telemetry to monitor device activity and detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. This ensures compliance and builds customer trust.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt Data At Rest**: Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data stored on devices. This protects data from unauthorized access.
2. **Encrypt Data In Transit**: Use TLS 1.3 to encrypt data being transmitted. This secures data during transfer.
3. **Implement PKI**: Use Public Key Infrastructure for managing digital certificates. This ensures secure communications.
4. **Follow GDPR**: Adhere to GDPR requirements for data handling. This protects user privacy and avoids penalties.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a rapid response plan for security incidents. This minimizes damage and protects our reputation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Deploy SIEM**: Use Security Information and Event Management for centralized logging. This helps in monitoring and analyzing security events.
2. **Maintain Honeypots**: Set up Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. This provides insights into potential attacks.
3. **Follow Least Privilege**: Ensure that personnel have only the access necessary for their roles during investigations. This limits exposure.
4. **Use Air Gap**: Implement an Air Gap for forensic analysis. This isolates sensitive data from the network.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory post-incident reviews. Document lessons learned for future improvements.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud. This protects our information and enhances operational efficiency.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt Data**: Use strong encryption methods for data stored in the cloud. This protects against unauthorized access.
2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to limit who can access cloud data. Use RBAC to manage permissions effectively.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure all cloud storage practices comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2. This mitigates legal risks.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to these security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage practices will be conducted. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly.
