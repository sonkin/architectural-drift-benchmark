# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security and protect our assets. By implementing strong authentication methods, we reduce risks and improve trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring access to corporate resources.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA.
   - Users must provide at least two forms of verification.
   
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length: 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords must be rotated every three months.
   - Track historical passwords to prevent reuse.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - High-security access requires biometric verification.
   - Ensure biometric data is securely stored and managed.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Define SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure availability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to ensure that only authorized personnel access our network. Implementing a Zero Trust architecture enhances our security posture.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Implement RBAC for all access decisions.
   - Assign access based on job roles and responsibilities.

2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for administrative access.
   - Ensure it is monitored and secured.

3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on sensitivity levels.
   - Limit access to sensitive data to authorized users only.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: 
   - Monitor all devices connected to the network.
   - Collect and analyze data for potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Protecting data ensures compliance with regulations and builds customer trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates.
   - Ensure secure communication between systems.

3. **Compliance with GDPR**: 
   - Follow GDPR requirements for data handling.
   - Ensure data privacy and protection for all users.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response to security incidents. Quick action minimizes damage and protects our organization.

### Scope
This policy covers all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events.
   - Analyze logs for potential threats.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats.
   - Use findings to improve security measures.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: 
   - Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.
   - Limit access to only what is necessary.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis of incidents.
   - Ensure that forensic data is isolated from the main network.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned to improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure data stored in the cloud. Protecting cloud data enhances our operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud.
   - Use strong encryption standards to protect sensitive information.

2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement strict access controls for cloud storage.
   - Use RBAC to limit access based on user roles.

3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR.
   - Regularly review cloud storage practices for compliance.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with cloud storage security measures.

## Glossary

- **Zero Trust**: A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: A security process that requires two or more verification methods to gain access.
