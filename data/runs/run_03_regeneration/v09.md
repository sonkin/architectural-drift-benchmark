# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our organization’s assets. Strong authentication enhances security and builds trust with clients.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring access to sensitive information.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA.
   - Users must provide at least two forms of verification.
   
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length: 12 characters.
   - Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Rotate passwords every three months.
   - Track historical passwords to prevent reuse.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - High-security access requires biometric authentication.
   - Ensure biometric data is securely stored and processed.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Define uptime expectations for identity providers.
   - Regularly review SLA compliance.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. This approach reduces risks and protects sensitive data.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Implement RBAC for all access decisions.
   - Assign access based on job roles and responsibilities.

2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for administrative access.
   - Ensure it is monitored and secured.

3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on data sensitivity.
   - Limit access to sensitive areas.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: 
   - Monitor devices for unusual activity.
   - Use telemetry data to enhance security measures.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Protecting data ensures compliance and builds customer confidence.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates.
   - Ensure certificates are regularly updated and monitored.

3. **Compliance with GDPR**: 
   - Follow GDPR guidelines for data handling.
   - Ensure data privacy and protection measures are in place.

### Exceptions
Test environments may have relaxed encryption standards. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a rapid response plan for security incidents. Quick action minimizes damage and protects our reputation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events.
   - Regularly review logs for anomalies.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats.
   - Analyze data from Honeypots to improve security.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: 
   - Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.
   - Limit access to only what is necessary.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.
   - Ensure that forensic systems are isolated from the main network.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory post-incident reviews. Document lessons learned for future reference.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud. Secure cloud storage protects sensitive information and supports business continuity.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud.
   - Use strong encryption standards to protect data.

2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement strict access controls for cloud storage.
   - Regularly review access permissions.

3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations.
   - Regularly audit cloud services for compliance.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to security standards.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO.
