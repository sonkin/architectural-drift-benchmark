# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security through robust authentication methods. By implementing strong authentication, we protect our assets and improve overall business resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All critical systems must use MFA. This includes a combination of something you know (password), something you have (token), and something you are (biometric).
   
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length: 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords must be rotated every three months.
   - Historical password tracking: Users cannot reuse the last five passwords.
   - Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt.

3. **Identity Federation**: 
   - Implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications to streamline access.
   - Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems.
   - Require biometric verification for high-security access.
   - Define Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation to management after three violations within six months.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section focuses on restricting network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our security posture.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all devices connected to our network.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC for all access decisions. This ensures that users have access only to the information necessary for their roles.
   
2. **Bastion Host**: Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. This adds an additional layer of security.

3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. This limits exposure and reduces the risk of data breaches.

4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect and respond to anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review is required. See Section 1 for further details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an immediate investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to the security team after two incidents within a month.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring data security, we comply with SOC2 requirements and enhance our reputation with clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Implement PKI for managing digital certificates and ensuring secure communications.

3. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data and avoid legal penalties.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $2,000, with escalation to legal after two violations within a year.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective response, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in incident response.

### Directives
1. **Centralized Logging**: Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized logging of security events.

2. **Threat Detection**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze potential threats.

3. **Investigation Protocols**: Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access to sensitive information.

4. **Forensic Analysis**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure that compromised systems are isolated from the network.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented and shared with relevant stakeholders. Penalties for failing to report incidents may include fines of up to $1,500, with escalation to management after one incident.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods.

2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access cloud-stored data.

3. **Compliance**: Ensure that all cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the outlined security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance may result in fines of up to $2,500, with escalation to the CISO after two violations within a year.

## Glossary

- **Zero Trust**: A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: A security process that requires two or more verification methods to gain access to a resource.
- **Bastion Host**: A special-purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: A method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users.
