# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.

For corporate applications, we will implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems. High-security access will require Biometric verification to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Additionally, we will define a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for identity provider uptime to ensure reliable access.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly to ensure compliance with security standards.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties assessed based on the severity of the breach. The escalation timeline for addressing violations will be within 48 hours of detection.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
We will implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions, ensuring that users have the minimum necessary access to perform their job functions. Administrative access will be managed through a Bastion Host, which serves as a secure gateway. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and we will monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect any anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but it will require a post-incident review to ensure that proper protocols were followed. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to identify any unauthorized access attempts. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with findings reported to management.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Sensitive data must be encrypted when at rest using AES-256 encryption standards. Data in transit must also be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. We will implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for certificate management to ensure secure communications. Additionally, we will adhere to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements for data handling to protect personal information.

### Exceptions
In test environments, we may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. By preparing for incidents, we can protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
We will deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, we will follow the principle of Least Privilege, ensuring that personnel have only the access necessary to perform their duties. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to protect sensitive data during investigations.

### Exceptions
No exceptions will be made; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews will be mandatory, with lessons learned documented for future reference. Any failure to comply with incident response protocols will result in penalties, including potential disciplinary action, with a review timeline of 72 hours.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring that sensitive data is protected while leveraging the benefits of cloud technology. By implementing strong security measures, we can enhance our operational efficiency and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but they must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will result in penalties, including potential fines and access restrictions, with a review timeline of 48 hours.
