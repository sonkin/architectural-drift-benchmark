# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication methods, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize MFA. This adds an extra layer of security, making unauthorized access significantly more difficult. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly to minimize risks. Additionally, we will track historical passwords to prevent reuse and ensure compliance with our security standards. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.

For high-security access, we will require Biometric verification. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. We will also define an SLA for identity provider uptime to guarantee reliable access to our systems.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly to ensure compliance with our security standards.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties assessed based on the severity of the breach. Escalation timelines will be established to ensure timely resolution of issues.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
The goal of this policy is to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we can ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
We will implement RBAC for all access decisions, ensuring that users have access only to the resources necessary for their roles. Administrative access will be managed through a Bastion Host, providing a secure gateway for sensitive operations. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity to limit exposure. Continuous monitoring will be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect and respond to potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review will be required to assess the situation. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to identify any unauthorized access attempts. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties applied based on the severity of the incident.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Sensitive data must be encrypted when Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. Additionally, Data In Transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. We will implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications. Compliance with GDPR data handling requirements is mandatory to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
In test environments, relaxed encryption may be permitted. However, production data must never be included in test environments to maintain security.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action, with penalties applied based on the severity of the violation.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. By being prepared, we can protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
We will deploy a SIEM for centralized logging of security events, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats proactively. During investigations, we will adhere to the principle of Least Privilege, ensuring that personnel have only the access necessary to perform their duties. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to protect sensitive data during investigations.

### Exceptions
No exceptions will be made; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews will be mandatory, with lessons learned documented for future reference. Penalties for non-compliance will be assessed based on the severity of the incident, with escalation timelines established to ensure timely resolution.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring that sensitive data is protected while leveraging the benefits of cloud technology. By implementing strong security measures, we can enhance our operational efficiency and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage solutions must adhere to the established security measures.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will result in penalties, with escalation timelines established for addressing non-compliance.
