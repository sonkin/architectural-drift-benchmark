# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication methods, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. We will implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be defined for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which should also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties for non-compliance may include a fine of up to $500, and escalation timelines will be established to ensure timely resolution.

## Network Access Control Policy

### Purpose
This policy restricts network access to authorized personnel only, implementing a Zero Trust architecture to enhance security. By ensuring that only verified users can access sensitive resources, we protect our organization from potential threats.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions will be governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Administrative access must be conducted through a Bastion Host to minimize exposure. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and monitoring will be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted but will require a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an investigation, and penalties for violations may include fines of up to $1,000, with escalation timelines established for prompt action.

## Data Protection Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Sensitive data must be encrypted when at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) will be implemented for certificate management, and all data handling must comply with GDPR regulations.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), with penalties potentially reaching $2,000 for serious violations.

---

## Incident Response Policy

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. By preparing for incidents, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system will be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege must be followed to limit access. An Air Gap will be used for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned must be documented. Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $1,500, with established timelines for escalation.

## Cloud Storage Security Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and compliance with industry standards. By protecting our cloud assets, we enhance operational efficiency and safeguard sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions utilized by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, must be maintained to protect user data.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be monitored through regular audits. Non-compliance may result in penalties of up to $2,500, with escalation timelines established for resolution.
