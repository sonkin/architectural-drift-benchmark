# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing strong authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure robust authentication, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All critical systems must require MFA. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords. Employees should set up MFA using their mobile devices or hardware tokens.

2. **Password Complexity**: Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Password Rotation**: Passwords should be changed every three months. Notifications will be sent to remind users of upcoming password expiration.

4. **Credential Storage**: All credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.

5. **Biometric Verification**: For high-security access, biometric verification methods should be implemented to enhance security.

6. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: Define an SLA for the uptime of identity providers to ensure reliable access.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. These exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly to ensure compliance with security standards. For isolated systems, local authentication may be used, but this must also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties may include a warning for the first offense, a suspension of access for the second offense, and termination for the third offense. All incidents will be escalated within 48 hours.

## Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy applies to all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
To maintain secure network access, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access decisions must be based on user roles. Each role should have specific permissions aligned with job responsibilities.

2. **Bastion Host**: Administrative access must be conducted through a Bastion Host, which serves as a secure gateway to sensitive systems.

3. **Network Segmentation**: Networks should be segmented based on sensitivity levels to limit access to critical data.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: Continuous monitoring of devices connected to the network is essential. This helps detect anomalies and potential threats.

### Exceptions
In emergency situations, access may be granted with a post-incident review. All exceptions must be documented and justified.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access attempts will trigger an immediate investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include temporary suspension or permanent revocation of access, depending on the severity of the incident.

## Data Protection

### Purpose
This section focuses on protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements, we safeguard our data and enhance trust with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
To protect sensitive data, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. This ensures that stored data is secure from unauthorized access.

2. **Data In Transit**: Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data as it moves across networks.

3. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Implement PKI for managing digital certificates, ensuring secure communications.

4. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data and ensure privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action. Penalties may include fines or disciplinary action, depending on the nature of the violation.

## Incident Response

### Purpose
This section establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective incident management, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
To ensure a swift and effective incident response, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. These systems simulate vulnerabilities to attract potential attackers.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: During investigations, access should be granted based on the least privilege principle, ensuring that personnel only have access necessary for their roles.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence during investigations.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented and shared with relevant stakeholders. Penalties for failing to comply with incident response protocols may include disciplinary action or termination, depending on the severity of the oversight.

## Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This section outlines the security measures for cloud storage. By implementing strong security practices, we protect our data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
To secure cloud storage, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**: All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. This protects data from unauthorized access.

2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access cloud-stored data. This includes using RBAC and MFA.

3. **Compliance**: Ensure that all cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but these must be documented and reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with security standards.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage security will be conducted. Non-compliance may result in penalties, including fines or loss of access to cloud resources.
