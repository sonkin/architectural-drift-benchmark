### Scope
All employees and contractors. All systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse for at least five cycles.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions. Review monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel. Implement Zero Trust architecture.

### Scope
All network infrastructure. All connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements.

### Scope
All data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data never in test.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits. Non-compliance escalated to CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish rapid response to security incidents. Minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
All security events. All personnel involved in response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews mandatory. Lessons learned documented.

## 5. Identity Federation

### Purpose
Enable secure single sign-on capabilities. Reduce password fatigue.

### Scope
All corporate applications. External partner integrations.

### Directives
Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Federation logs monitored. Anomalies trigger alerts.

## 6. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure storage of data in the cloud. Protect against unauthorized access.

### Scope
All cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AES-256. Implement strict access controls. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including HIPAA.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be granted for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.
