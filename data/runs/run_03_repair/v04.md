# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
This policy sets rules for secure authentication methods. It helps protect our organization's information and reduce password fatigue.

### Scope
This applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems requiring authentication, including corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in passwords. Change passwords every three months. Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt. Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles. Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications. Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Monitor federation logs. Repeated violations may lead to loss of access. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This policy limits network access to authorized users. It supports a Zero Trust approach.

### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative tasks. Separate networks based on sensitivity. Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to keep sensitive data safe. It ensures we follow SOC2 standards.

### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data.

### Directives
Encrypt data stored on devices using AES-256. Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3. Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates. Follow GDPR rules for handling data. Ensure protection for Data At Rest and Data In Transit.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy outlines how to respond quickly to security issues. It aims to reduce damage using the Kill Chain method.

### Scope
This applies to all security incidents. All personnel involved in responses must follow this policy.

### Directives
Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats. Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy ensures data is stored securely in the cloud. It protects against unauthorized access.

### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt data both at rest and in transit using AES-256. Implement strict access controls. Ensure compliance with relevant laws, including HIPAA.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Regularly audit cloud storage settings. Report non-compliance to the CISO.
