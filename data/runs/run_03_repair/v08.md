# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems requiring authentication, including corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Ensure that passwords include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to enhance security.
3. **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to prompt users to update their passwords regularly.
4. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing, making them more secure.
5. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles.** Maintain a password history to prevent users from recycling old passwords.
6. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications.
7. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems.** Implement SAML to facilitate single sign-on for older applications.
8. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** Use fingerprint or facial recognition technology to enhance security for sensitive areas.
9. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to guarantee access.
10. **Understand the Kill Chain framework for threat analysis.** This helps identify and mitigate potential security threats effectively.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Monitor federation logs. Repeated violations may lead to loss of access. Any anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This policy secures our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A Zero Trust approach enhances our operational integrity and protects valuable assets.

### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for administrative tasks.** This secure server acts as a gateway for administrative access to critical systems.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Implement tools to track and analyze endpoint behavior for potential security threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy safeguards sensitive data, ensuring compliance with SOC2 standards. Protecting our data enhances trust and drives business growth through secure practices.

### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored on devices using AES-256.** This encryption standard provides strong protection for sensitive information at rest.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** Ensure that all data transmitted over networks is secured with the latest encryption protocols.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Implement PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates securely.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for handling data.** Ensure compliance with data protection regulations when processing personal information.
5. **Ensure protection for Data At Rest and Data In Transit.** Apply encryption and access controls to safeguard data in both states.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our reputation, ensuring business continuity.

### Scope
This applies to all security incidents. All personnel involved in responses must follow this policy.

### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data from across the organization.
2. **Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats.** Deploy decoy systems to lure attackers and gather intelligence on their methods.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Limit access to only those who need it to minimize potential damage.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** Physically isolate systems to prevent unauthorized access during investigations.

### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy ensures secure cloud data storage. Protecting our data enhances operational efficiency and supports compliance with industry standards.

### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt data both at rest and in transit using AES-256.** This ensures that sensitive information is protected during storage and transmission.
2. **Implement strict access controls.** Define user roles and permissions to limit access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
3. **Ensure compliance with relevant laws, including HIPAA.** Regularly review cloud storage practices to align with legal requirements for data protection.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Regularly audit cloud storage settings. Report non-compliance to the CISO.

## 6. Glossary

### Purpose
This section defines key terms used in the Cybersecurity Policy. Understanding these terms is essential for compliance and effective implementation.

### Scope
This glossary applies to all personnel involved in cybersecurity practices within the organization.
