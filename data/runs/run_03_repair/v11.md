# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security Policies

### 1.1 Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency. See Section 3.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems requiring authentication, including corporate applications and external partner systems. See Section 2.1.

#### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. See Section 3.1.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Ensure that passwords include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. See Section 3.1.
3. **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders to prompt users to update their passwords regularly. See Section 1.2.
4. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing. See Section 3.1.
5. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles.** Maintain a password history to prevent recycling old passwords. See Section 3.1.
6. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications. See Section 3.1.
7. **Support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems.** Implement SAML to facilitate single sign-on for older applications. See Section 3.1.
8. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** Use fingerprint or facial recognition technology for sensitive areas. See Section 3.1.
9. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage. See Section 3.1.
10. **Understand the Kill Chain framework for threat analysis.** This helps identify and mitigate potential security threats. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document and review these exceptions annually. See Section 1.2.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time violations result in a warning and a $100 fine. Repeat violations within six months will incur a $500 fine. After three violations, access may be suspended for 30 days. All violations must be reported to the security team within 24 hours. See Section 1.2.

### 1.2 Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy secures our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A Zero Trust approach enhances operational integrity. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. See Section 2.1.

#### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. See Section 3.1.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for administrative tasks.** This secure server acts as a gateway for administrative access. See Section 3.1.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data. See Section 1.3.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Implement tools to track and analyze endpoint behavior. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will result in penalties. A first violation incurs a $200 fine and a warning. A second violation within a year results in a $600 fine. A third violation leads to a 60-day access suspension. All incidents must be reported to the security team within 48 hours. See Section 1.1.

### 1.3 Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards sensitive data, ensuring compliance with SOC2 standards. Protecting our data enhances trust and drives business growth. See Section 2.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
1. **Encrypt data stored on devices using AES-256.** This encryption standard provides strong protection for sensitive information. See Section 3.1.
2. **Encrypt data being sent using TLS 1.3.** Ensure that all data transmitted over networks is secured. See Section 3.1.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** Implement PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates. See Section 3.1.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for handling data.** Ensure compliance with data protection regulations. See Section 3.1.
5. **Ensure protection for Data At Rest and Data In Transit.** Apply encryption and access controls to safeguard data. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests. See Section 1.2.

#### Enforcement
Penalties for violations include a $300 fine for the first offense. A second offense within a year incurs a $700 fine. A third offense results in a 90-day suspension of access to sensitive data. All violations must be reported to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) within 24 hours. See Section 1.1.

---

### 1.4 Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our reputation. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all security incidents. All personnel involved in responses must follow this policy. See Section 2.1.

#### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data. See Section 3.1.
2. **Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats.** Deploy decoy systems to lure attackers and gather intelligence. See Section 3.1.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Limit access to only those who need it. See Section 3.1.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** Physically isolate systems to prevent unauthorized access. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $400 fine for the first incident. A second incident within a year results in an $800 fine. A third incident leads to a mandatory 120-day training program on incident response. All incidents must be documented and reported to the security team within 24 hours. See Section 1.1.
