# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security Policies

### 1.1 Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency. See Section 3.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems requiring authentication, including corporate applications and external partner systems. See Section 2.1.

#### Directives
All users must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems, requiring two or more verification factors to gain access. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Users must change passwords every three months, with reminders set to prompt regular updates. Passwords must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt, which adds random data to passwords before hashing. Users must keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles, maintaining a password history to prevent recycling. For modern applications, OpenID Connect (OIDC) must be used, allowing secure authentication and authorization for web applications. Legacy systems should support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to facilitate single sign-on. Biometric verification is required for high-security access, utilizing fingerprint or facial recognition technology for sensitive areas. Service Level Agreements (SLA) must be set for identity provider uptime, ensuring a minimum uptime percentage. Users should understand the Kill Chain framework for threat analysis, which helps identify and mitigate potential security threats. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document and review these exceptions annually. See Section 1.2.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time violations result in a warning and a $100 fine. Repeat violations within six months will incur a $500 fine. After three violations, access may be suspended for 30 days. All violations must be reported to the security team within 24 hours. See Section 1.2.

### 1.2 Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy secures our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A Zero Trust approach enhances operational integrity. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. See Section 2.1.

#### Directives
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be used for all access decisions, assigning permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. A Bastion Host should be used for administrative tasks, acting as a secure gateway for administrative access. Networks must be separated based on sensitivity, creating distinct segments to protect sensitive data. Activity must be monitored with Endpoint Telemetry, implementing tools to track and analyze endpoint behavior. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will result in penalties. A first violation incurs a $200 fine and a warning. A second violation within a year results in a $600 fine. A third violation leads to a 60-day access suspension. All incidents must be reported to the security team within 48 hours. See Section 1.1.

---

### 1.3 Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards sensitive data, ensuring compliance with SOC2 standards. Protecting our data enhances trust and drives business growth. See Section 2.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
Data stored on devices must be encrypted using AES-256, providing strong protection for sensitive information. Data being sent must also be encrypted using TLS 1.3, ensuring that all transmitted data is secured. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) should be used for managing certificates, allowing for the issuance, management, and revocation of digital certificates. Compliance with GDPR rules for handling data is essential, ensuring adherence to data protection regulations. Protection must be ensured for both Data At Rest and Data In Transit, applying encryption and access controls to safeguard data. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests. See Section 1.2.

#### Enforcement
Penalties for violations include a $300 fine for the first offense. A second offense within a year incurs a $700 fine. A third offense results in a 90-day suspension of access to sensitive data. All violations must be reported to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) within 24 hours. See Section 1.1.

---

### 1.4 Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our reputation. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all security incidents. All personnel involved in responses must follow this policy. See Section 2.1.

#### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must be used for logging, collecting and analyzing security data. Honeypot systems should be maintained to detect threats, deploying decoy systems to lure attackers and gather intelligence. The Least Privilege principle must be followed during investigations, limiting access to only those who need it. An Air Gap should be used for forensic analysis, physically isolating systems to prevent unauthorized access. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $400 fine for the first incident. A second incident within a year results in an $800 fine. A third incident leads to a mandatory 120-day training program on incident response. All incidents must be documented and reported to the security team within 24 hours. See Section 1.1.

## 2. HR Security Policies

### 2.1 Cloud Storage Security

#### Purpose
This policy ensures secure cloud data storage. Protecting our data enhances operational efficiency and supports compliance. See Section 1.3.

#### Scope
This applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
Data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit using AES-256, ensuring that sensitive information is protected. Strict access controls must be implemented, defining user roles and permissions to limit access to sensitive data. Compliance with relevant laws, including HIPAA, is essential, requiring regular reviews of cloud storage practices to align with legal requirements. See Section 3.1.

#### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
First violations will incur a $250 fine. A second violation within a year results in a $500 fine. A third violation leads to a 60-day suspension of access to cloud storage services. All violations must be reported to the CISO within 48 hours. See Section 1.1.
