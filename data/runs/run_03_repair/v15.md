# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## IT Security Policies

### Authentication

#### Purpose
This policy enhances our organization's security posture. Secure authentication methods protect valuable information and improve operational efficiency. Remember, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is essential. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all employees and contractors. It covers all systems requiring authentication, including corporate applications and external partner systems. A Zero Trust approach is vital. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
All users must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems, requiring two or more verification factors to gain access. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Users must change passwords every three months, with reminders set to prompt regular updates. Passwords must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt, which adds random data to passwords before hashing. Users must keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse for five cycles, maintaining a password history to prevent recycling. For modern applications, OpenID Connect (OIDC) must be used, allowing secure authentication and authorization for web applications. Legacy systems should support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to facilitate single sign-on. Biometric verification is required for high-security access, utilizing fingerprint or facial recognition technology for sensitive areas. A Bastion Host should be used for administrative tasks, acting as a secure gateway for administrative access. Service Level Agreements (SLA) must be set for identity provider uptime, ensuring a minimum uptime percentage. Users should understand the Kill Chain framework for threat analysis, which helps identify and mitigate potential security threats. Always remember, a Zero Trust approach is necessary. See Section 1.2.

#### Exceptions
Older systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. For example, if a legacy application does not support MFA, it may be allowed for a limited time. Document and review these exceptions annually. Ensure MFA is implemented where possible. If a user is unable to access MFA due to a technical issue, they must report it immediately. Temporary access may be granted until the issue is resolved. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur penalties. First-time violations result in a warning and a $100 fine. Repeat violations within six months will incur a $500 fine. After three violations, access may be suspended for 30 days. All violations must be reported to the security team within 24 hours. Remember, adherence to MFA is crucial. See Section 1.1.

### Network Access Control

#### Purpose
This policy secures our network, ensuring only authorized users gain access. A Zero Trust approach enhances operational integrity. Always apply MFA for network access. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all network equipment and connected devices. A Zero Trust model is essential for security. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be used for all access decisions, assigning permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. Networks must be separated based on sensitivity, creating distinct segments to protect sensitive data. Activity must be monitored with Endpoint Telemetry, implementing tools to track and analyze endpoint behavior. Always remember, MFA is a critical component of security. See Section 1.1.

#### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. For instance, if a network administrator needs immediate access to resolve a critical issue, they may bypass standard protocols temporarily. Ensure MFA is applied whenever possible. If an emergency occurs outside of normal hours, a documented process must be followed to grant access. All exceptions must be logged and reviewed to ensure compliance. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will result in penalties. A first violation incurs a $200 fine and a warning. A second violation within a year results in a $600 fine. A third violation leads to a 60-day access suspension. All incidents must be reported to the security team within 48 hours. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is necessary. See Section 1.1.

### Data Protection

#### Purpose
This policy safeguards sensitive data, ensuring compliance with SOC2 standards. Protecting our data enhances trust and drives business growth. Always apply MFA for data access. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all sensitive data. A Zero Trust approach is essential for data protection. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
Data stored on devices must be encrypted using AES-256, providing strong protection for sensitive information. Data being sent must also be encrypted using TLS 1.3, ensuring that all transmitted data is secured. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) should be used for managing certificates, allowing for the issuance, management, and revocation of digital certificates. Compliance with GDPR rules for handling data is essential, ensuring adherence to data protection regulations. Protection must be ensured for both Data At Rest and Data In Transit, applying encryption and access controls to safeguard data. Always remember, MFA is crucial for data security. See Section 1.1.

#### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. For example, if developers need to test applications, they may use less stringent encryption temporarily. However, production data must never be used in tests. Ensure MFA is applied where possible. If testing requires access to sensitive data, a separate environment must be created. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed regularly. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Penalties for violations include a $300 fine for the first offense. A second offense within a year incurs a $700 fine. A third offense results in a 90-day suspension of access to sensitive data. All violations must be reported to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) within 24 hours. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is vital. See Section 1.1.

---

### Incident Response

#### Purpose
This policy outlines our proactive approach to security incidents. Quick responses minimize damage and protect our reputation. Always apply MFA during incident responses. See Section 1.1.

#### Scope
This applies to all security incidents. All personnel involved in responses must follow this policy. A Zero Trust approach is essential. See Section 1.2.

#### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must be used for logging, collecting and analyzing security data. Honeypot systems should be maintained to detect threats, deploying decoy systems to lure attackers and gather intelligence. The Least Privilege principle must be followed during investigations, limiting access to only those who need it. An Air Gap should be used for forensic analysis, physically isolating systems to prevent unauthorized access. Always remember, MFA is critical during incident response. See Section 1.1.

#### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response. Ensure MFA is applied consistently. If a user cannot access MFA during an incident, they must notify the security team immediately. A temporary workaround may be established, but it must be documented. See Section 1.1.

#### Enforcement
Violations will incur a $400 fine for the first incident. A second incident within a year results in an $800 fine. A third incident leads to a mandatory 120-day training program on incident response. All incidents must be documented and reported to the security team within 24 hours. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is necessary. See Section 1.1.
