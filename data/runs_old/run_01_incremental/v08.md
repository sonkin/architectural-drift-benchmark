# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Establish robust authentication practices that not only protect the organization's vital information but also enhance operational efficiency. By implementing secure single sign-on and clear password guidelines, we empower employees to focus on their core responsibilities while minimizing the hassle of managing multiple passwords.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems that require a password, including all corporate applications and external partner systems.

### Directives
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to the system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification).
  
- **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** When creating a password, ensure that it meets these criteria by using a combination of different character types and avoiding easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

- **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders in your calendar or use password management tools to notify you when it is time to update your passwords, ensuring that you do not reuse old passwords.

- **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a reputable password manager to store your passwords, which encrypts your data and allows you to access your passwords with a master password.

- **Keep a record of the last 5 passwords to avoid using them again.** Maintain a secure log of your previous passwords in your password manager, ensuring that you do not repeat any of the last five used passwords when creating a new one.

- **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** When integrating authentication systems, ensure that OIDC is implemented for new applications, while maintaining SAML for legacy systems to facilitate secure access.

- **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric systems such as fingerprint or facial recognition for users accessing sensitive information or systems, ensuring that only authorized personnel can gain entry.

- **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, minimizing downtime that could affect access to critical systems.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly or annually as applicable.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access. Monitor access logs for any unusual activity. Anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Implementing a Zero Trust approach to network access not only secures our infrastructure but also enhances our overall business agility. By limiting access to authorized individuals, we can ensure that our resources are protected while enabling teams to work efficiently and collaboratively.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices.

### Directives
- **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on the roles of users within the organization, ensuring that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions.

- **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure that administrative tasks are performed on a dedicated, secure server that is isolated from general user access, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes.

- **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible through secure channels and to authorized personnel.

- **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor and analyze endpoint activity, allowing for the identification of potential security threats in real-time.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive information throughout its lifecycle is not just a compliance requirement; it is a strategic investment in our organization's reputation and trustworthiness. By ensuring data security, we enhance customer confidence and drive business growth while adhering to SOC2 standards.

### Scope
Includes all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
- **Secure data stored on devices using strong encryption.** Utilize encryption protocols such as AES-256 to protect data at rest on all devices, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the information without the proper decryption keys.

- **Protect data being transmitted over the internet.** Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit, ensuring that sensitive information is not intercepted during transmission.

- **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing security certificates.** Establish a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization.

- **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR regulations, including obtaining consent from individuals before collecting their data and providing them with rights to access and delete their information.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed security measures. Never use production data in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
A well-defined incident response plan is essential for minimizing damage and maintaining business continuity. By preparing for security incidents, we not only protect our assets but also reinforce our commitment to operational resilience and stakeholder trust.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
- **Use a centralized logging system for monitoring.** Implement a centralized logging solution that aggregates logs from all systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events.

- **Maintain systems to detect threats.** Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to continuously monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and respond accordingly.

- **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that personnel involved in incident investigations have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties, reducing the risk of further compromise.

- **Use isolated systems for in-depth analysis.** Conduct detailed investigations on isolated systems that are not connected to the main network, preventing any potential spread of threats during the analysis process.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing data in cloud services is vital for protecting our organization against unauthorized access and data breaches. By prioritizing cloud storage security, we not only safeguard our information but also enhance our competitive advantage in the digital landscape.

### Scope
Covers all data stored in cloud services and all personnel with access.

### Directives
- **Encrypt all data stored in the cloud.** Use strong encryption methods to protect data at rest in cloud storage, ensuring that only authorized users can access the information.

- **Protect data being transmitted using strong encryption.** Implement encryption protocols such as TLS to secure data in transit to and from cloud services, preventing interception by unauthorized parties.

- **Implement strict access controls.** Establish access control policies that limit who can access cloud data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions to view or modify sensitive information.

- **Regularly review and update who has access.** Conduct periodic reviews of user access to cloud services, removing any unnecessary permissions and ensuring that only current employees have access to sensitive data.

- **Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA.** Regularly assess cloud storage practices to ensure they align with applicable legal requirements, including data protection and privacy regulations.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
