# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Department

### Purpose
Establish robust cybersecurity practices that protect the organization's vital information and enhance operational efficiency. By implementing secure authentication, network access control, data protection, incident response, and cloud storage security measures, we empower employees to focus on their core responsibilities while minimizing risks.

### Scope
Applies to all IT personnel and systems managed by the IT department.

### Directives

#### Authentication
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to the system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification).
  
- **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** When creating a password, ensure that it meets these criteria by using a combination of different character types and avoiding easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

- **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders in your calendar or use password management tools to notify you when it is time to update your passwords, ensuring that you do not reuse old passwords.

- **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a reputable password manager to store your passwords, which encrypts your data and allows you to access your passwords with a master password.

- **Keep a record of the last 5 passwords to avoid using them again.** Maintain a secure log of your previous passwords in your password manager, ensuring that you do not repeat any of the last five used passwords when creating a new one.

- **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** When integrating authentication systems, ensure that OIDC is implemented for new applications, while maintaining SAML for legacy systems to facilitate secure access.

- **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric systems such as fingerprint or facial recognition for users accessing sensitive information or systems, ensuring that only authorized personnel can gain entry.

- **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, minimizing downtime that could affect access to critical systems.

#### Network Access Control
- **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on the roles of users within the organization, ensuring that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions.

- **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure that administrative tasks are performed on a dedicated, secure server that is isolated from general user access, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes.

- **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible through secure channels and to authorized personnel.

- **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor and analyze endpoint activity, allowing for the identification of potential security threats in real-time.

#### Data Protection
- **Secure data stored on devices using strong encryption.** Utilize encryption protocols such as AES-256 to protect data at rest on all devices, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the information without the proper decryption keys.

- **Protect data being transmitted over the internet.** Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit, ensuring that sensitive information is not intercepted during transmission.

- **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing security certificates.** Establish a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization.

- **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR regulations, including obtaining consent from individuals before collecting their data and providing them with rights to access and delete their information.

#### Incident Response
- **Use a centralized logging system for monitoring.** Implement a centralized logging solution that aggregates logs from all systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events.

- **Maintain systems to detect threats.** Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to continuously monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and respond accordingly.

- **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that personnel involved in incident investigations have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties, reducing the risk of further compromise.

- **Use isolated systems for in-depth analysis.** Conduct detailed investigations on isolated systems that are not connected to the main network, preventing any potential spread of threats during the analysis process.

#### Cloud Storage Security
- **Encrypt all data stored in the cloud.** Use strong encryption methods to protect data at rest in cloud storage, ensuring that only authorized users can access the information.

- **Protect data being transmitted using strong encryption.** Implement encryption protocols such as TLS to secure data in transit to and from cloud services, preventing interception by unauthorized parties.

- **Implement strict access controls.** Establish access control policies that limit who can access cloud data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions to view or modify sensitive information.

- **Regularly review and update who has access.** Conduct periodic reviews of user access to cloud services, removing any unnecessary permissions and ensuring that only current employees have access to sensitive data.

- **Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA.** Regularly assess cloud storage practices to ensure they align with applicable legal requirements, including data protection and privacy regulations.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly or annually as applicable.

### Enforcement
Report any violations to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to losing access. Monitor access logs for any unusual activity. Anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. HR Department

### Purpose
Ensure that all employees and contractors are aware of and comply with cybersecurity policies to protect sensitive information and maintain organizational integrity.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors.

### Directives
- **Educate employees on password management and security practices.** Provide training sessions on creating strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, and the importance of multi-factor authentication.

- **Conduct regular security awareness training.** Implement mandatory training programs for all employees to ensure they understand their role in maintaining cybersecurity and are aware of current threats.

- **Establish a clear reporting process for security incidents.** Ensure that all employees know how to report suspicious activities or potential security breaches promptly.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1 for details.

### Enforcement
Review access logs weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Legal Department

### Purpose
Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding data protection and privacy, safeguarding the organization against legal risks.

### Scope
Applies to all legal matters related to cybersecurity.

### Directives
- **Ensure compliance with GDPR and HIPAA.** Regularly assess organizational practices to ensure alignment with data protection laws and regulations.

- **Review contracts with third-party vendors for compliance.** Ensure that all contracts with service providers include clauses that address data protection and cybersecurity responsibilities.

- **Provide legal guidance on incident response.** Assist in developing incident response plans that comply with legal requirements and protect the organization’s interests.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed security measures. Never use production data in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report any non-compliance to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
