# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Department

### Purpose
Establish robust cybersecurity practices that protect the organization's vital information and enhance operational efficiency. By implementing secure authentication, network access control, data protection, incident response, and cloud storage security measures, we empower employees to focus on their core responsibilities while minimizing risks.

### Scope
Applies to all IT personnel and systems managed by the IT department.

### Directives

#### Authentication
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical systems.** This involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to the system, which may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification). See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.** When creating a password, ensure that it meets these criteria by using a combination of different character types and avoiding easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Change passwords every three months.** Set reminders in your calendar or use password management tools to notify you when it is time to update your passwords, ensuring that you do not reuse old passwords. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Store passwords securely.** Utilize a reputable password manager to store your passwords, which encrypts your data and allows you to access your passwords with a master password. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Keep a record of the last 5 passwords to avoid using them again.** Maintain a secure log of your previous passwords in your password manager, ensuring that you do not repeat any of the last five used passwords when creating a new one. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for older systems.** When integrating authentication systems, ensure that OIDC is implemented for new applications, while maintaining SAML for legacy systems to facilitate secure access. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Require biometric verification for high-security access.** Implement biometric systems such as fingerprint or facial recognition for users accessing sensitive information or systems, ensuring that only authorized personnel can gain entry. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Set service level agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Establish clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, minimizing downtime that could affect access to critical systems. See Section 5 for definitions.

#### Network Access Control
- **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions.** Assign permissions based on the roles of users within the organization, ensuring that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Use a secure server for administrative tasks.** Ensure that administrative tasks are performed on a dedicated, secure server that is isolated from general user access, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible through secure channels and to authorized personnel. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Monitor activity with endpoint tracking.** Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor and analyze endpoint activity, allowing for the identification of potential security threats in real-time. See Section 5 for definitions.

#### Data Protection
- **Secure data stored on devices using strong encryption.** Utilize encryption protocols such as AES-256 to protect data at rest on all devices, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the information without the proper decryption keys. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Protect data being transmitted over the internet.** Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit, ensuring that sensitive information is not intercepted during transmission. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing security certificates.** Establish a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Follow GDPR guidelines for handling data.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR regulations, including obtaining consent from individuals before collecting their data and providing them with rights to access and delete their information. See Section 5 for definitions.

#### Incident Response
- **Use a centralized logging system for monitoring.** Implement a centralized logging solution that aggregates logs from all systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Maintain systems to detect threats.** Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to continuously monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and respond accordingly. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations.** Ensure that personnel involved in incident investigations have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties, reducing the risk of further compromise. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Use isolated systems for in-depth analysis.** Conduct detailed investigations on isolated systems that are not connected to the main network, preventing any potential spread of threats during the analysis process. See Section 5 for definitions.

#### Cloud Storage Security
- **Encrypt all data stored in the cloud.** Use strong encryption methods to protect data at rest in cloud storage, ensuring that only authorized users can access the information. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Protect data being transmitted using strong encryption.** Implement encryption protocols such as TLS to secure data in transit to and from cloud services, preventing interception by unauthorized parties. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Implement strict access controls.** Establish access control policies that limit who can access cloud data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions to view or modify sensitive information. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Regularly review and update who has access.** Conduct periodic reviews of user access to cloud services, removing any unnecessary permissions and ensuring that only current employees have access to sensitive data. See Section 5 for definitions.

- **Ensure compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA.** Regularly assess cloud storage practices to ensure they align with applicable legal requirements, including data protection and privacy regulations. See Section 5 for definitions.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly or annually as applicable. See Section 2 for exceptions.

### Enforcement
Any violations of the cybersecurity policy will result in penalties based on the severity of the infraction. For minor infractions, such as failure to update passwords on time, a warning will be issued, and the individual will have 14 days to rectify the issue. Repeated minor infractions may lead to a fine of $100 per incident after the third occurrence within a six-month period. For moderate infractions, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, a fine of $500 will be imposed, and the individual will be required to attend a mandatory retraining session within 30 days. Severe infractions, including data breaches or failure to report incidents, will result in a fine of $1,000 and may lead to suspension or termination of access privileges, with a review of the case escalating to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) within 48 hours. All incidents will be documented, and access logs will be monitored for unusual activity, triggering alerts for any anomalies. See Section 2 for enforcement.
