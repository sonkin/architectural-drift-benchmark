# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Department

### Purpose
Establish robust cybersecurity practices that protect the organization's vital information and enhance operational efficiency. By implementing secure authentication, network access control, data protection, incident response, and cloud storage security measures, we empower employees to focus on their core responsibilities while minimizing risks. It is essential to adopt a Zero Trust approach, ensuring that every access request is verified, and to utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

### Scope
Applies to all IT personnel and systems managed by the IT department.

### Directives

#### Authentication
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for all critical systems, which involves requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to the system. These factors may include something they know (a password), something they have (a mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification). Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. When creating a password, ensure that it meets these criteria by using a combination of different character types and avoiding easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words. Passwords must be changed every three months, and users should set reminders in their calendars or use password management tools to notify them when it is time to update their passwords, ensuring that they do not reuse old passwords. It is essential to store passwords securely by utilizing a reputable password manager that encrypts data and allows access to passwords with a master password. Users should keep a record of the last five passwords to avoid using them again, maintaining a secure log of previous passwords in their password manager to ensure that they do not repeat any of the last five used passwords when creating a new one. OpenID Connect (OIDC) should be used for modern applications, while Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) should be supported for older systems. When integrating authentication systems, ensure that OIDC is implemented for new applications while maintaining SAML for legacy systems to facilitate secure access. Biometric verification is required for high-security access, implementing systems such as fingerprint or facial recognition for users accessing sensitive information or systems, ensuring that only authorized personnel can gain entry. Service level agreements (SLA) should be set for identity provider uptime, establishing clear SLAs with identity providers to ensure that authentication services are reliable and available, minimizing downtime that could affect access to critical systems. Remember, adopting a Zero Trust model is crucial, and MFA must be enforced for all access points.

#### Network Access Control
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be used for all access decisions, assigning permissions based on the roles of users within the organization to ensure that individuals only have access to the information necessary for their job functions. A secure server should be used for administrative tasks, ensuring that these tasks are performed on a dedicated, secure server that is isolated from general user access, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized changes. Networks should be separated based on sensitivity, creating distinct network segments for different levels of data sensitivity to ensure that sensitive information is only accessible through secure channels and to authorized personnel. Activity should be monitored with endpoint tracking by implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor and analyze endpoint activity, allowing for the identification of potential security threats in real-time. Always apply a Zero Trust approach to network access, and ensure MFA is utilized for all critical systems.

#### Data Protection
Data stored on devices must be secured using strong encryption, utilizing encryption protocols such as AES-256 to protect data at rest on all devices, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the information without the proper decryption keys. Data being transmitted over the internet should be protected by implementing Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit, ensuring that sensitive information is not intercepted during transmission. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) should be used for managing security certificates, establishing a PKI to issue, manage, and revoke digital certificates, ensuring secure communications and authentication across the organization. All data processing activities must follow GDPR guidelines, ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations, including obtaining consent from individuals before collecting their data and providing them with rights to access and delete their information. Remember to implement a Zero Trust strategy for data access and enforce MFA for all sensitive data transactions.

#### Incident Response
A centralized logging system for monitoring must be used, implementing a centralized logging solution that aggregates logs from all systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events. Systems should be maintained to detect threats by utilizing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to continuously monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and respond accordingly. The principle of Least Privilege should be followed during investigations, ensuring that personnel involved in incident investigations have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties, thereby reducing the risk of further compromise. Isolated systems should be used for in-depth analysis, conducting detailed investigations on isolated systems that are not connected to the main network to prevent any potential spread of threats during the analysis process. Always apply a Zero Trust model during incident response, and ensure that MFA is utilized for accessing incident response tools and data.

#### Cloud Storage Security
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted, using strong encryption methods to protect data at rest in cloud storage, ensuring that only authorized users can access the information. Data being transmitted should be protected using strong encryption, implementing encryption protocols such as TLS to secure data in transit to and from cloud services, preventing interception by unauthorized parties. Strict access controls must be implemented, establishing access control policies that limit who can access cloud data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions to view or modify sensitive information. Regular reviews and updates of who has access should be conducted, periodically reviewing user access to cloud services, removing any unnecessary permissions, and ensuring that only current employees have access to sensitive data. Compliance with relevant laws like GDPR and HIPAA must be ensured, regularly assessing cloud storage practices to ensure they align with applicable legal requirements, including data protection and privacy regulations. Remember to enforce a Zero Trust approach for cloud access and utilize MFA for all cloud service logins.

### Exceptions
Older systems may temporarily use just a password for access. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document any exceptions and review them monthly or annually as applicable. See Section 2 for exceptions.

### Enforcement
Any violations of the cybersecurity policy will result in penalties based on the severity of the infraction. For minor infractions, such as failure to update passwords on time, a warning will be issued, and the individual will have 14 days to rectify the issue.
