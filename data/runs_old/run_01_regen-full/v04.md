# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards. Protect organizational assets and reduce risks.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track password history for the last five passwords. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document exceptions and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel. Implement Zero Trust architecture for enhanced security.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with post-incident review. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Ensure compliance with SOC2 and GDPR requirements.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits conducted. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents. Minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection. Follow Least Privilege during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned for future reference.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure storage of data in the cloud. Protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud. Implement access controls based on RBAC. Regularly review cloud storage compliance with relevant regulations.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Regular audits of cloud storage practices. Non-compliance reported to the security team.
