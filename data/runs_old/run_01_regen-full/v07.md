# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish strong authentication standards to protect our assets and enhance security. This approach reduces risks and increases trust in our systems.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. Covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.
