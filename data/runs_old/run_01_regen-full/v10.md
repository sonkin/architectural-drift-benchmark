# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication to protect assets and enhance productivity. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves trust in our systems.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Minimum password length: 12 characters. Passwords must include upper, lower, numeric, and special characters. Rotate passwords quarterly. Track password history for the last five changes. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions and review monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Penalties may include a $500 fine for first violations, escalating to $1,000 for repeated violations. Access revocation may occur after three violations within six months.
