# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance operational efficiency. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include complexity requirements. Passwords must be rotated quarterly, and history tracking must prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. For corporate applications, implement OIDC for modern systems and SAML for legacy systems. High-security access requires Biometric verification. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, ensuring a secure environment that supports business operations. Implementing Zero Trust architecture enhances our security posture.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity to minimize risk. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to maintain trust and comply with industry standards. Protecting data enhances our reputation and reduces liability.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Ensure compliance with GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response framework for security incidents to minimize damage and ensure business continuity. Effective incident response protects our assets and reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events effectively. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to protect sensitive data.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to capture lessons learned and improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect organizational assets and maintain compliance. Secure cloud storage enhances operational efficiency and reduces risk.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR, is mandatory to protect sensitive information.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage solutions must adhere to the established security requirements.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly to mitigate risks.
