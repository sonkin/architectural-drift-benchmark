# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Secure authentication enhances our organizational integrity and protects valuable assets. Strong authentication methods improve user trust and reduce security risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords must be rotated quarterly and must not be reused for at least five cycles. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. High-security access requires Biometric verification. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restricting network access to authorized personnel enhances security and protects sensitive information. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures that every access request is verified.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle ensures compliance and builds customer trust. Effective data protection strategies enhance our reputation and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols. Implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establishing a rapid response to security incidents minimizes damage and protects our assets. A well-defined incident response strategy enhances our resilience against threats.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
Deploy a SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented to improve future responses.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Securing cloud storage protects sensitive data and ensures compliance with regulations. Effective cloud security strategies enhance operational efficiency and reduce risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using strong encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access based on user roles. Compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR, is mandatory.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but they must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO for action.
