# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect our assets and enhance user experience. This approach reduces risks and improves operational efficiency.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. Covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
Implement MFA for all critical systems. Ensure a minimum password length of 12 characters. Require at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. Rotate passwords quarterly and track historical passwords for the last five changes. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. For high-security access, require Biometric verification.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team within 24 hours. Repeated violations may result in access revocation within 30 days. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and protecting sensitive information. This approach minimizes potential threats and improves compliance.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. Applies to all personnel accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity to limit exposure. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry. Regularly review access permissions.

### Exceptions
Emergency access allowed with a post-incident review. Document and justify all exceptions. See Section 1 for additional details.

### Enforcement
Access logs reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation within 48 hours. Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance and protecting our reputation. This strategy enhances trust and mitigates risks.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. Covers all storage and transmission methods.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements strictly. Regularly review data classification.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments. Document exceptions and review annually.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO within 14 days. Immediate corrective actions required for identified issues.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage and ensuring business continuity. This proactive approach protects our assets and reputation.

### Scope
Covers all security events and all personnel involved in incident response. Applies to all departments.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection and analysis. Follow Least Privilege principles during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity. Document all incidents thoroughly.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response. Ensure all personnel are trained on response procedures.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory within 72 hours. Document lessons learned and implement improvements within 30 days. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud, protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance. This approach enhances trust and operational efficiency.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization. Covers all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256 encryption. Implement access controls based on RBAC principles. Regularly review access permissions and compliance with SOC2 requirements. Ensure data handling aligns with GDPR regulations.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document and review these exceptions quarterly.

### Enforcement
Conduct biannual audits of cloud storage security. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO within 14 days. Immediate corrective actions required for identified issues.
