Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications. Support SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Document exceptions. Review monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Penalties may include access revocation. Repeated violations within 30 days escalate to management.
