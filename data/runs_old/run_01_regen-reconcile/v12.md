# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish strong authentication methods to protect our assets. Secure access enhances trust and reduces risks, driving business success.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. Covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
Use MFA for all critical systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly and track history for the last five passwords. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may use single-factor authentication temporarily. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document exceptions and review annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Penalties may include access revocation after three violations within six months.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing Zero Trust architecture enhances security and protects sensitive data.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. Applies to all personnel accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks by sensitivity. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs are reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation. Penalties may include access restrictions for repeat offenders.

Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO may result in penalties, including fines up to $5,000.
