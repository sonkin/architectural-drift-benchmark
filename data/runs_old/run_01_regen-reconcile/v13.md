# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication methods to protect assets and enhance operational efficiency. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves user trust.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to enhance security. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be rotated quarterly, and history tracking requires at least five previous passwords. Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. For high-security access, Biometric verification is mandatory. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation within 30 days. Federation logs will be monitored, and anomalies will trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. Implementing Zero Trust architecture enhances security and reduces potential attack surfaces.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels to minimize risk. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry for real-time insights.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for additional authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties for confirmed breaches.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to ensure compliance and protect organizational reputation. Effective data protection enhances customer trust and business value.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for effective certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to ensure compliance with regulations.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO within 14 days for further action.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a rapid response framework for security incidents to minimize damage and recover quickly. Effective incident response protects assets and maintains business continuity.

### Scope
Covers all security events and involves all personnel engaged in incident response.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to enhance visibility. Maintain Honeypot systems for proactive threat detection. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, with lessons learned documented within 7 days. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud to protect sensitive information and maintain compliance. Secure cloud storage enhances operational efficiency and reduces risk.

### Scope
Applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using industry-standard encryption methods. Implement strict access controls to limit data access to authorized personnel only. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but must be documented and reviewed quarterly.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO, with corrective actions required within 30 days.
