# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets and enhance user experience. Strong authentication reduces risks and improves overall security posture.

### Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. Covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Rotate passwords quarterly and track history for the last five passwords. Store credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt. Implement OIDC for modern applications and SAML for legacy systems. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Define SLA for identity provider uptime.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Isolated systems may use local authentication. Document and review exceptions annually.

### Enforcement
Violations reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation within 30 days. Federation logs monitored; anomalies trigger alerts.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and protecting sensitive information. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures only verified users access resources.

### Scope
Covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. Applies to all employees and contractors accessing the network.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access. Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for additional details.

### Enforcement
Access logs are reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access triggers an investigation within 48 hours.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with regulations like SOC2. Protecting data enhances trust and mitigates risks.

### Scope
Applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. Covers all employees and contractors handling such data.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 protocols. Implement PKI for certificate management. Follow GDPR data handling requirements strictly.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption. Production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance escalated to the CISO within 14 days.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage and ensuring business continuity. Effective incident response protects organizational reputation and assets.

### Scope
Covers all security events and personnel involved in the response process. Applies to all employees and contractors.

### Directives
Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Maintain Honeypot systems for proactive threat detection. Follow Least Privilege principles during investigations. Use Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
