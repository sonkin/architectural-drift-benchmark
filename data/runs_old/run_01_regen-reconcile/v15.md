# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish secure authentication standards to protect organizational assets. Strong authentication enhances security and reduces risks, ensuring business continuity and trust.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication. It covers all corporate applications and external partner integrations.

### Directives
1. Use MFA for all critical systems to enhance security.
2. Set a minimum password length of 12 characters.
3. Require at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.
4. Rotate passwords quarterly to maintain security.
5. Track historical passwords to prevent reuse.
6. Store credentials using Cryptographic Salt for added protection.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication; these must be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation within 30 days. Non-compliance will escalate to management.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Restrict network access to authorized personnel, enhancing security and protecting sensitive data. Implementing Zero Trust architecture ensures only verified users access resources.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices. It applies to all employees and contractors accessing the network.

### Directives
1. Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure proper permissions.
2. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems.
3. Segment networks by sensitivity to limit exposure.
4. Monitor network activity with Endpoint Telemetry for anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but requires a post-incident review. Document all emergency access instances. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access will trigger an investigation within 48 hours. Consequences may include access restrictions or disciplinary action.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. Effective data protection enhances business reputation and reduces legal risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher. It includes data stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization.

### Directives
1. Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to safeguard stored information.
2. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.
3. Implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications.
4. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to maintain compliance.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments. Document all exceptions for review.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will assess compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO within 14 days for further action.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Establish a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage and protect organizational assets. A swift response enhances resilience and maintains stakeholder confidence.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in incident response. It includes all employees and contractors.

### Directives
1. Deploy SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events.
2. Maintain Honeypot systems for threat detection and analysis.
3. Follow Least Privilege principles during investigations to limit access.
4. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to protect sensitive data.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response. Each incident must be reviewed and analyzed for future improvements.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory within 7 days of an incident. Lessons learned must be documented and shared with relevant teams.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure secure cloud storage practices to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance. Effective cloud security enhances operational efficiency and reduces risks.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization. It includes all data stored in the cloud.

### Directives
1. Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using AES-256.
2. Implement access controls to restrict data access to authorized personnel.
3. Regularly review cloud service provider compliance with industry standards.
4. Monitor cloud storage activity for unusual access patterns.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects. Document all exceptions and review them quarterly to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Compliance will be assessed during quarterly audits. Non-compliance will be reported to the CISO within 14 days for corrective action.
