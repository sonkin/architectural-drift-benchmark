# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy defines secure authentication standards to protect our organizational assets and ensure user identity verification.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication.

### Directives
1. **Use MFA**: All critical systems must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords must not contain easily guessable information, such as names or birthdays.
   - Passwords must be rotated every three months.
   - Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.
3. **Credential Storage**: Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to revocation of access privileges.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. We will implement a Zero Trust architecture to enhance security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all devices connected to our network.

### Directives
1. **RBAC Implementation**: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all access decisions. This ensures users only have access necessary for their roles.
2. **Bastion Host Usage**: Administrative access must go through a Bastion Host to secure sensitive operations.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity levels to limit exposure.
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This section aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle and ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption to protect stored data.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission.
2. **PKI Implementation**: Implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing digital certificates.
3. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be present in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This section establishes a rapid response to security incidents to minimize damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
1. **SIEM Deployment**: Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized logging of security events.
2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats.
3. **Investigative Protocols**: Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access to sensitive information.
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned to improve future responses.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This section aims to secure cloud storage solutions to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage services used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using strong encryption methods.
2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access cloud data.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure all cloud storage practices comply with applicable regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the outlined security measures.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be reported to the security team.
