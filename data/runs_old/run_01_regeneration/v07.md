# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
Establish strong authentication methods to protect our valuable assets. Secure access enhances trust and reduces risks, ultimately supporting business growth.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
   - All critical systems must use MFA. 
   - Users should authenticate using at least two methods, such as a password and a mobile app.

2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length is 12 characters. 
   - Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords should not contain easily guessable information, such as birthdays or names.
   - Passwords must be rotated every three months.
   - Track historical passwords to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Biometric Verification**: 
   - For high-security access, implement biometric methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 
   - Define uptime expectations for identity providers to ensure reliable access.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly.

### Enforcement
Violations will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may lead to access revocation.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized personnel only. This approach enhances security and protects sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - Implement RBAC to ensure users have access only to necessary resources.
   - Regularly review access permissions to maintain security.

2. **Bastion Host**: 
   - Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems.
   - Ensure that only authorized personnel can access this host.

3. **Network Segmentation**: 
   - Segment networks based on data sensitivity to minimize exposure.
   - Regularly assess network segments for vulnerabilities.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: 
   - Monitor all devices connected to the network using Endpoint Telemetry.
   - Analyze telemetry data for unusual activity.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted with a post-incident review. See Section 1 for more details.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. Protecting data ensures compliance and builds customer trust, enhancing our reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: 
   - Implement PKI for managing digital certificates and encryption keys.
   - Regularly review and update certificates to maintain security.

3. **GDPR Compliance**: 
   - Follow GDPR guidelines for data handling and processing.
   - Ensure that data subjects' rights are respected.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be in test environments.

### Enforcement
Conduct quarterly audits. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a swift response plan for security incidents. Quick action minimizes damage and protects our assets, ensuring business continuity.

### Scope
This policy covers all security events and personnel involved in the response.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 
   - Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events.
   - Regularly analyze logs for potential threats.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: 
   - Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats.
   - Use insights gained to improve security measures.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: 
   - Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations to limit access.
   - Ensure that only necessary personnel have access to sensitive information.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: 
   - Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence.
   - Document all forensic procedures for accountability.

### Exceptions
None. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Document lessons learned to improve future responses.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure the security of data stored in the cloud. Protecting cloud data enhances operational efficiency and supports business objectives.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt all data stored in the cloud using strong encryption methods.
   - Regularly review encryption standards to ensure compliance.

2. **Access Controls**: 
   - Implement strict access controls for cloud storage.
   - Use RBAC to limit access based on user roles.

3. **Compliance**: 
   - Ensure that cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations, such as GDPR.
   - Regularly audit cloud storage for compliance and security.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly.
