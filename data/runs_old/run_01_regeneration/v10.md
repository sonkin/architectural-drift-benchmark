# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to enhance security through robust authentication methods. By implementing strong authentication, we protect our assets and improve overall business resilience.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring user authentication across the organization.

### Directives
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All critical systems must use MFA. This includes a combination of something you know (password), something you have (token), and something you are (biometric).
   
2. **Password Requirements**: 
   - Minimum password length: 12 characters.
   - Passwords must include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords should not contain easily guessable information, such as birthdays or names.
   - Passwords must be rotated every three months.
   - Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Biometric Verification**: For high-security access, biometric verification is mandatory. This adds an additional layer of security.

4. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: Define an SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure availability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly to ensure compliance.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation to management after three violations within a six-month period.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to ensure that only authorized personnel can access our network. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we enhance security and protect sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC for all access decisions. This ensures that users have access only to the information necessary for their roles.

2. **Bastion Host**: Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. This adds a layer of security by isolating administrative tasks.

3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity levels. This limits access to sensitive data and reduces the risk of breaches.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: Monitor all devices connected to the network using Endpoint Telemetry. This helps in identifying and responding to potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review is required. See Section 1 for more details on access control.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an investigation. Penalties for unauthorized access may include fines of up to $1,000, with escalation to the security team after two incidents.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy is designed to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring data security, we comply with regulations and build trust with our clients.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards.
   - Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Implement PKI for managing digital certificates. This ensures secure communications and data integrity.

3. **Compliance with GDPR**: Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data and ensure privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards. However, production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $2,000, with escalation to legal after two violations.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. This proactive measure helps in understanding attack patterns.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. This limits access to only those who need it.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure that compromised systems are isolated from the network.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory. Lessons learned must be documented and shared with relevant stakeholders. Penalties for failing to comply with incident response procedures may include fines of up to $1,500, with escalation to the security team after one incident.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure data stored in the cloud. By implementing strong security measures, we protect sensitive information and ensure compliance.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
1. **Data Encryption**: All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods.

2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to limit who can access cloud-stored data. Use RBAC to manage permissions effectively.

3. **Compliance**: Ensure that all cloud storage solutions comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage must adhere to the security requirements outlined in this policy.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with cloud storage security measures. Non-compliance may result in fines of up to $2,000, with escalation to the CISO after two violations.

## Glossary

- **Zero Trust**: A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources.
