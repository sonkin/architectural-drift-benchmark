# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
All critical systems must use MFA to ensure secure access. Passwords must have a minimum length of 12 characters and include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be implemented to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. We will implement OIDC for modern applications and support SAML for legacy systems. Additionally, we will define an SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which should also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation timelines set at 30 days for resolution.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
We will implement RBAC for all access decisions, ensuring that users have access only to the resources necessary for their roles. Administrative access will be managed through a Bastion Host to provide an additional layer of security. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and we will monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect any anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review will be required. See Section 1 for related authentication policies.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to ensure compliance. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with potential penalties including fines of up to $1,000 for breaches.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we build trust with our clients and stakeholders, enhancing our reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
We will encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption to protect stored data. Data In Transit will be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. We will implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications. Compliance with GDPR data handling requirements is mandatory to protect personal data.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action, which may include fines of up to $2,000.

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective incident management, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
We will deploy a SIEM for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, we will follow the principle of Least Privilege to limit access to necessary personnel only. Forensic analysis will utilize an Air Gap to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to evaluate the response and identify lessons learned. Non-compliance with incident response procedures may result in penalties of up to $3,000, with escalation timelines set at 14 days for resolution.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and compliance. By protecting our cloud assets, we enhance operational efficiency and reduce risks associated with data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits will ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but they must be documented and reviewed quarterly.

### Enforcement
Violations of cloud storage security policies will be reported to the security team. Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $1,500, with escalation timelines set at 30 days for resolution.
