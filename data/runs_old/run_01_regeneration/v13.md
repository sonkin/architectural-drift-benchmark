# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication methods, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize MFA. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse. Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. Implement OIDC for modern applications and support SAML for legacy systems. Define an SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability. 

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. Document all exceptions and review them monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which must also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation, with penalties assessed based on the severity of the breach. Escalation timelines will be established to ensure timely resolution.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, enhancing our overall security.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure that users have the minimum necessary access. Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems. Network segmentation by sensitivity is essential to limit exposure. Monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect anomalies.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted but requires a post-incident review. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties applied based on the nature of the breach.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust and protect our reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher.

### Directives
Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 to protect stored information. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to secure data during transmission. Implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications. Follow GDPR data handling requirements to maintain compliance with regulations.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be included in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance. Non-compliance will be escalated to the CISO for further action.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
This section establishes a rapid response to security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. A swift response protects our assets and maintains business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
Deploy a SIEM for centralized logging to monitor security events. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats. Follow the principle of Least Privilege during investigations to limit access to sensitive information. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to ensure data integrity.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned must be documented. Penalties for non-compliance will be assessed based on the severity of the incident, with escalation timelines established for timely resolution.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data protection and compliance. By implementing strong security measures, we enhance our operational efficiency and protect our assets.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions used by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits must be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but they must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will result in penalties, with escalation timelines established for addressing non-compliance.

## Glossary

- **Zero Trust**: A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources.
- **MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication, a security measure that requires two or more verification methods.

- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control, a method of restricting system access based on user roles.
- **Data At Rest**: Data that is stored physically in any digital form (e.g., databases, data warehouses).
- **Data In Transit**: Data actively moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network.
- **Least Privilege**: A security principle that grants users the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job functions.
- **Air Gap**: A security measure that involves isolating a computer or network from unsecured networks, such as the internet.
- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement, a contract that defines the level of service expected from a service provider.
- **Biometric**: A security process that relies on unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition.
- **Cryptographic Salt**: Random data added to passwords before hashing to protect against dictionary attacks.
- **PKI**: Public Key Infrastructure, a framework for managing digital certificates and public-key encryption.
- **Endpoint Telemetry**: The collection of data from endpoints to monitor and analyze security events.
- **SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management, a solution that aggregates and analyzes security data.
- **SOC2**: A framework for managing customer data based on five "trust service principles": security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation, a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy.
- **OIDC**: OpenID Connect, an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0.
- **SAML**: Security Assertion Markup Language, an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
- **Kill Chain**: A model for understanding the stages of a cyber attack.
