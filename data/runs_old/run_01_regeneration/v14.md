# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing robust authentication methods, we enhance our security posture and reduce risks, ultimately driving business value.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and systems requiring authentication across the organization.

### Directives
To ensure secure access, all critical systems must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be rotated quarterly, and historical password tracking must be enforced to prevent reuse of the last five passwords. Credentials must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt to enhance security.

For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. We will implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for legacy systems. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be defined for identity provider uptime to ensure reliability.

### Exceptions
Legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. Isolated systems may use local authentication, which should also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties for non-compliance will be determined based on the severity of the violation, with escalation timelines established for each case.

## Network Access Control Policy

### Purpose
This policy restricts network access to authorized personnel only, implementing a Zero Trust architecture to enhance security. By ensuring that only verified users can access our network, we protect sensitive information and maintain operational integrity.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
Access decisions will be governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring that users have access only to the resources necessary for their roles. A Bastion Host will be used for administrative access, providing an additional layer of security. Networks will be segmented based on sensitivity levels, and monitoring will be conducted using Endpoint Telemetry to detect any unauthorized access.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted, but a post-incident review will be required. See Section 1 for related authentication requirements.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to ensure compliance. Any unauthorized access will trigger an immediate investigation, with penalties applied based on the nature of the breach.

## Data Protection Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements. By safeguarding our data, we enhance trust with our clients and stakeholders, ultimately driving business success.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
Sensitive data must be encrypted when at rest using AES-256 encryption standards. Data in transit must also be encrypted using TLS 1.3 to protect against interception. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) will be implemented for certificate management, ensuring secure communications. Compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data handling requirements is mandatory.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Any non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further action.

---

## Incident Response Policy

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents, minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis. By preparing for incidents, we can protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and personnel involved in the response process.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system will be deployed for centralized logging of security events. Honeypot systems will be maintained to detect and analyze threats. During investigations, the principle of Least Privilege will be followed to limit access to sensitive information. An Air Gap will be utilized for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted; all incidents require a documented response.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory, and lessons learned must be documented to improve future responses. Penalties for non-compliance will be determined based on the severity of the incident, with specific escalation timelines established.

## Cloud Storage Security Policy

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions, ensuring data integrity and compliance with industry standards. By protecting our cloud data, we enhance operational efficiency and safeguard our reputation.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions utilized by the organization.

### Directives
All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods. Access controls must be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

### Exceptions
None. All cloud storage solutions must adhere to the established security protocols.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team, with penalties applied based on the severity of the breach.

## Glossary

- **Zero Trust**: A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources.
- **MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication, a security process that requires multiple forms of verification to access systems.
- **Bastion Host**: A secure server designed to withstand attacks, used for administrative access.
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control, a method of restricting system access based on user roles.
- **Data At Rest**: Data that is stored physically in any digital form (e.g., databases, data warehouses).
- **Data In Transit**: Data actively moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network.
- **Least Privilege**: A security principle that grants users the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job functions.
- **Air Gap**: A security measure that involves isolating a computer or network from other networks, including the internet.
- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement, a contract that defines the level of service expected from a service provider.
- **Biometric**: Authentication methods that use unique biological traits, such as fingerprints or facial recognition.
- **Cryptographic Salt**: Random data added to passwords before hashing to protect against dictionary attacks.
- **PKI**: Public Key Infrastructure, a framework for managing digital certificates and public-key encryption.
- **Endpoint Telemetry**: The collection of data from endpoints to monitor and analyze security events.
