# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## Authentication Policy

### Purpose
The goal of this policy is to establish secure authentication standards that protect our organizational assets. By implementing strong authentication measures, we enhance our security posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access, ultimately safeguarding our business interests and ensuring a return on investment.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees and contractors who access corporate systems requiring authentication. It encompasses all applications and services used within the organization.

### Directives
To ensure robust authentication, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All critical systems must utilize MFA. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
   
2. **Password Complexity**: Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Historical password tracking is required to prevent reuse of the last five passwords.

3. **Password Rotation**: Passwords should be rotated quarterly to minimize the risk of compromise.

4. **Credential Storage**: Store all credentials securely using Cryptographic Salt to protect against unauthorized access.

5. **Biometric Verification**: For high-security access, biometric verification methods should be employed to enhance security.

6. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: Define an SLA for identity provider uptime to ensure reliable access.

### Exceptions
In certain cases, legacy systems may temporarily use single-factor authentication. These exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly. For isolated systems, local authentication may be permitted, but this must also be documented and reviewed annually.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be reported to the security team. Repeated violations may result in access revocation. Specific penalties may include a fine of up to $500 for non-compliance, with escalation timelines set at 30 days for initial violations and 15 days for subsequent violations.

## Network Access Control

### Purpose
This section aims to restrict network access to authorized personnel only. By implementing a Zero Trust architecture, we ensure that every access request is verified, thereby enhancing our security framework and protecting sensitive information.

### Scope
This policy covers all network infrastructure and all connected devices within the organization.

### Directives
To maintain secure network access, the following directives must be followed:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC for all access decisions to ensure that users have the minimum necessary access to perform their job functions.

2. **Bastion Host**: Use a Bastion Host for administrative access to critical systems, ensuring that all administrative actions are monitored and controlled.

3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks based on sensitivity to limit access to sensitive data and systems.

4. **Endpoint Telemetry**: Continuously monitor network activity using Endpoint Telemetry to detect and respond to potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access may be granted in critical situations, but a post-incident review must follow. See Section 1 for additional details on authentication exceptions.

### Enforcement
Access logs will be reviewed weekly to ensure compliance. Unauthorized access attempts will trigger an immediate investigation. Penalties for violations may include fines of up to $1,000, with a 30-day timeline for initial violations and 15 days for repeat offenses.

## Data Protection

### Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. By ensuring compliance with SOC2 requirements, we enhance our reputation and build trust with clients and stakeholders.

### Scope
This policy applies to all data classified as sensitive or higher within the organization.

### Directives
To protect sensitive data, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt Data At Rest using AES-256 encryption standards. Encrypt Data In Transit using TLS 1.3 to protect data during transmission.

2. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Implement PKI for certificate management to ensure secure communications.

3. **GDPR Compliance**: Follow GDPR data handling requirements to protect personal data and ensure privacy.

### Exceptions
Test environments may use relaxed encryption standards, but production data must never be stored in test environments. Document any exceptions and review them regularly.

### Enforcement
Quarterly audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance will be escalated to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Penalties for violations may include fines of up to $2,000, with a 30-day timeline for initial violations and 15 days for repeat offenses.

## Incident Response

### Purpose
This policy establishes a rapid response framework for security incidents. By minimizing damage through effective Kill Chain analysis, we protect our assets and maintain business continuity.

### Scope
This policy applies to all security events and all personnel involved in the incident response process.

### Directives
To ensure a swift and effective response to incidents, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Deploy SIEM for centralized logging of security events to facilitate monitoring and analysis.

2. **Honeypot Systems**: Maintain Honeypot systems to detect and analyze threats in real-time.

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations to limit access to sensitive information.

4. **Air Gap for Forensics**: Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis to prevent contamination of evidence.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are permitted. All incidents require a documented response to ensure accountability and learning.

### Enforcement
Post-incident reviews are mandatory to assess the effectiveness of the response. Lessons learned must be documented and shared with relevant stakeholders. Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to $3,000, with a 30-day timeline for initial violations and 15 days for repeat offenses.

## Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
This policy aims to secure cloud storage solutions used by the organization. By implementing strong security measures, we protect our data and enhance operational efficiency.

### Scope
This policy applies to all cloud storage solutions utilized by the organization.

### Directives
To secure cloud storage, the following measures must be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**: All data stored in the cloud must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods.

2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access cloud-stored data.

3. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards, including GDPR and SOC2.

### Exceptions
Temporary exceptions may be granted for specific projects, but these must be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Enforcement
Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy. Non-compliance may result in penalties of up to $2,500, with a 30-day timeline for initial violations and 15 days for repeat offenses.
