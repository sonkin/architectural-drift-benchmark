# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Set clear rules for secure authentication methods. Protect company information and reduce password fatigue.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems needing authentication.

### Directives
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for important systems. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Change passwords every three months. Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt. Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse. Require Biometric verification for high-security access. Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications. Support SAML for older systems. Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime. Ensure Data At Rest is encrypted.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document and review these cases annually.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Monitor federation logs. Repeated issues may lead to loss of access.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized users. Use a Zero Trust approach.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment. Includes all connected devices.

### Directives
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for access decisions. Use a Bastion Host for admin access. Separate networks based on sensitivity. Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive information throughout its life. Ensure compliance with SOC2 standards.

### Scope
Includes all sensitive data and higher classifications.

### Directives
Encrypt stored data using AES-256. Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.3. Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates. Follow GDPR rules for data handling.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the CISO.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a quick response plan for security issues. Reduce damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
Covers all security incidents. Involves all personnel in the response.

### Directives
Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging. Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats. Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations. Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.

### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure safe storage of data in the cloud. Protect against unauthorized access.

### Scope
Covers all cloud storage solutions used by the company.

### Directives
Encrypt all cloud-stored data using AES-256. Implement strict access controls based on roles. Ensure compliance with relevant laws, including HIPAA.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Regularly audit cloud storage settings. Report non-compliance to the CISO.
