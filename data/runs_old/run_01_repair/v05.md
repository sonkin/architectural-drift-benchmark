# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. Authentication

### Purpose
Set clear rules for secure authentication methods. Protect company information and reduce password fatigue.

### Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors. Covers all systems needing authentication.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters to enhance security.
3. **Change passwords every three months.** Notify users in advance to ensure timely updates and compliance.
4. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing, making them more secure.
5. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse.** Implement a system that prevents users from reusing their last five passwords.
6. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** This may include fingerprint or facial recognition systems for enhanced security.
7. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications.
8. **Support SAML for older systems.** This enables single sign-on capabilities for legacy applications.
9. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to avoid access issues.
10. **Ensure Data At Rest is encrypted.** Use strong encryption methods to protect sensitive data stored on devices.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. Isolated systems may use local passwords. Document and review these cases annually.

### Enforcement
Report violations to the security team. Monitor federation logs. Repeated issues may lead to loss of access.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Limit network access to authorized users. Use a Zero Trust approach.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment. Includes all connected devices.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for admin access.** This secure server acts as a gateway for administrative tasks, reducing exposure to threats.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Collect and analyze data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior and potential threats.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Check access logs weekly. Unauthorized access will lead to an investigation.

## 3. Data Protection

### Purpose
Safeguard sensitive information throughout its life. Ensure compliance with SOC2 standards.

### Scope
Includes all sensitive data and higher classifications.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt stored data using AES-256.** This encryption standard provides strong protection for sensitive information at rest.
2. **Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.3.** This ensures that data transmitted over networks is secure from interception.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** This system helps in issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates securely.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for data handling.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR requirements to protect user privacy.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests.

### Enforcement
Conduct audits every three months. Report non-compliance to the CISO.

---

## 4. Incident Response

### Purpose
Create a quick response plan for security issues. Reduce damage using Kill Chain analysis.

### Scope
Covers all security incidents. Involves all personnel in the response.

### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data from across the organization.
2. **Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats.** These decoy systems lure attackers, allowing the organization to study their tactics.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Limit access to only those who need it to minimize potential damage.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** This involves isolating affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise.

### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response.

### Enforcement
Conduct mandatory reviews after incidents. Document lessons learned.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security

### Purpose
Ensure safe storage of data in the cloud. Protect against unauthorized access.

### Scope
Covers all cloud storage solutions used by the company.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt all cloud-stored data using AES-256.** This ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.
2. **Implement strict access controls based on roles.** Assign permissions according to user roles to limit access to sensitive data.
3. **Ensure compliance with relevant laws, including HIPAA.** Regularly review policies to ensure adherence to legal requirements for data protection.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions.

### Enforcement
Regularly audit cloud storage settings. Report non-compliance to the CISO.
