# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security

### Purpose
Establish robust security measures to protect company assets. Secure access enhances trust and drives business efficiency. See Section 6.

### Scope
Applies to all IT personnel and systems requiring security measures. See Section 6.

### Directives
1. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for important systems. This requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. See Section 6.
2. **Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.** Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters to enhance security. See Section 6.
3. **Change passwords every three months.** Notify users in advance to ensure timely updates and compliance. See Section 6.
4. **Store passwords securely using Cryptographic Salt.** This process adds random data to passwords before hashing, making them more secure. See Section 6.
5. **Keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse.** Implement a system that prevents users from reusing their last five passwords. See Section 6.
6. **Require Biometric verification for high-security access.** This may include fingerprint or facial recognition systems for enhanced security. See Section 6.
7. **Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern applications.** This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization for web applications. See Section 6.
8. **Support SAML for older systems.** This enables single sign-on capabilities for legacy applications. See Section 6.
9. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLA) for identity provider uptime.** Ensure that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to avoid access issues. See Section 6.
10. **Ensure Data At Rest is encrypted.** Use strong encryption methods to protect sensitive data stored on devices. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. Document and review these cases annually. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Violations will incur a penalty of $500 for the first offense. A second offense within six months will escalate to $1,000. Repeated violations may lead to a review of access privileges. All incidents must be reported to the security team within 24 hours. See Section 6.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
Enhance business security by limiting network access to authorized users. A Zero Trust approach fosters a culture of accountability and trust. See Section 6.

### Scope
Covers all network equipment and connected devices. See Section 6.

### Directives
1. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for access decisions.** Assign permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. See Section 6.
2. **Use a Bastion Host for admin access.** This secure server acts as a gateway for administrative tasks, reducing exposure to threats. See Section 6.
3. **Separate networks based on sensitivity.** Create distinct network segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. See Section 6.
4. **Monitor activity with Endpoint Telemetry.** Collect and analyze data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior and potential threats. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Unauthorized access will incur a penalty of $750 for the first violation. A second violation within one year will escalate to $1,500. Continued violations may result in suspension of network access. All incidents must be reported to the security team within 48 hours. See Section 6.

## 3. Data Protection (Legal and Compliance)

### Purpose
Protect sensitive information to maintain customer trust and ensure compliance. Strong data protection enhances business reputation and operational integrity. See Section 6.

### Scope
Includes all sensitive data and higher classifications. See Section 6.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt stored data using AES-256.** This encryption standard provides strong protection for sensitive information at rest. See Section 6.
2. **Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.3.** This ensures that data transmitted over networks is secure from interception. See Section 6.
3. **Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for managing certificates.** This system helps in issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates securely. See Section 6.
4. **Follow GDPR rules for data handling.** Ensure that all data processing activities comply with GDPR requirements to protect user privacy. See Section 6.
5. **Adhere to SOC2 compliance standards.** Regularly review practices to ensure alignment with SOC2 requirements for data security. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. Never use production data in tests. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance will incur a penalty of $1,000 for the first offense. A second offense within one year will escalate to $2,000. Continued non-compliance may lead to legal action. All incidents must be reported to the CISO within 72 hours. See Section 6.

---

## 4. Incident Response (IT and HR)

### Purpose
Develop a proactive incident response plan to minimize damage. Quick responses protect business interests and enhance resilience. See Section 6.

### Scope
Covers all security incidents. Involves all personnel in the response. See Section 6.

### Directives
1. **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for logging.** This system collects and analyzes security data from across the organization. See Section 6.
2. **Maintain Honeypot systems to detect threats.** These decoy systems lure attackers, allowing the organization to study their tactics. See Section 6.
3. **Follow the Least Privilege principle during investigations.** Limit access to only those who need it to minimize potential damage. See Section 6.
4. **Use an Air Gap for forensic analysis.** This involves isolating affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise. See Section 6.
5. **Understand the Kill Chain model for threat analysis.** This framework helps identify stages of an attack and improve defenses. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
No exceptions. All incidents must have a documented response. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Failure to report incidents will incur a penalty of $1,500 for the first offense. A second offense within one year will escalate to $3,000. Continued failures may result in termination of employment. All incidents must be reported to the security team immediately. See Section 6.

---

## 5. Cloud Storage Security (IT and Finance)

### Purpose
Securely store data in the cloud to enhance business agility. Protecting data fosters innovation and competitive advantage. See Section 6.

### Scope
Covers all cloud storage solutions used by the company. See Section 6.

### Directives
1. **Encrypt all cloud-stored data using AES-256.** This ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access. See Section 6.
2. **Implement strict access controls based on roles.** Assign permissions according to user roles to limit access to sensitive data. See Section 6.
3. **Ensure compliance with relevant laws, including HIPAA.** Regularly review policies to ensure adherence to legal requirements for data protection. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. Document and review all exceptions. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance will incur a penalty of $1,000 for the first violation. A second violation within one year will escalate to $2,500. Continued non-compliance may lead to loss of cloud access. All incidents must be reported to the CISO within 48 hours. See Section 6.
