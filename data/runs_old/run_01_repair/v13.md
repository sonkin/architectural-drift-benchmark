# Corporate Cybersecurity Policy

## 1. IT Security

### Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish robust security measures to protect company assets. Secure access enhances trust and drives business efficiency. A Zero Trust approach is essential. See Section 6.

### Scope
This policy applies to all IT personnel and systems requiring security measures. All users must adhere to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protocols. See Section 6.

### Directives
All important systems must use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Users must provide two or more verification factors to gain access. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long. They must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters to enhance security. Users must change passwords every three months. Notifications will be sent in advance to ensure timely updates and compliance. Passwords must be stored securely using Cryptographic Salt. This adds random data to passwords before hashing, making them more secure. It is essential to keep track of old passwords to avoid reuse. Implement a system that prevents users from reusing their last five passwords. For high-security access, Biometric verification is required. This may include fingerprint or facial recognition systems for enhanced security. Modern applications should use OpenID Connect (OIDC). This protocol allows secure authentication and authorization. Older systems must support SAML. This enables single sign-on capabilities for legacy applications. Service Level Agreements (SLA) must be set for identity provider uptime. This ensures that identity providers maintain a minimum uptime percentage to avoid access issues. Finally, Data At Rest must be encrypted using strong encryption methods. This protects sensitive data stored on devices. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is vital for security. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Older systems may use simpler passwords for a short time. These cases must be documented and reviewed annually. All users must still follow MFA requirements. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy will incur a penalty of $500 for the first offense. A second offense within six months will escalate to $1,000. Repeated violations may lead to a review of access privileges. All incidents must be reported to the security team within 24 hours. Adherence to MFA and Zero Trust principles is mandatory. See Section 6.

## 2. Network Access Control

### Purpose
The purpose of this section is to enhance business security by limiting network access to authorized users. A Zero Trust approach fosters a culture of accountability and trust. MFA is also crucial for network security. See Section 6.

### Scope
This policy covers all network equipment and connected devices. All users must comply with MFA requirements. See Section 6.

### Directives
Access decisions must utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This assigns permissions based on user roles to minimize unnecessary access. A Bastion Host must be used for admin access. It acts as a secure gateway for administrative tasks and reduces exposure to threats. Networks should be separated based on sensitivity. This creates distinct segments to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Activity must be monitored with Endpoint Telemetry. This collects and analyzes data from endpoints to detect suspicious behavior and potential threats. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is essential for protecting network resources. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Emergency access is allowed but must be reviewed afterward. All users must still follow MFA protocols. See Section 1.

### Enforcement
Unauthorized access will incur a penalty of $750 for the first violation. A second violation within one year will escalate to $1,500. Continued violations may result in suspension of network access. All incidents must be reported to the security team within 48 hours. Adherence to Zero Trust and MFA principles is mandatory. See Section 6.

## 3. Data Protection (Legal and Compliance)

### Purpose
The purpose of this section is to protect sensitive information to maintain customer trust and ensure compliance. Strong data protection enhances business reputation and operational integrity. A Zero Trust approach is vital for data security. See Section 6.

### Scope
This policy includes all sensitive data and higher classifications. All users must comply with MFA requirements. See Section 6.

### Directives
Stored data must be encrypted using AES-256. This provides strong protection for sensitive information at rest. Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3. This ensures that data transmitted over networks is secure from interception. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) must be used for managing certificates. This helps in issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates securely. All data handling must follow GDPR rules. This ensures that all data processing activities comply with GDPR requirements to protect user privacy. Additionally, practices must adhere to SOC2 compliance standards. Regular reviews will ensure alignment with SOC2 requirements for data security. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is essential for protecting sensitive data. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Testing environments may have relaxed encryption rules. However, production data must never be used in tests. All users must still follow MFA protocols. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance will incur a penalty of $1,000 for the first offense. A second offense within one year will escalate to $2,000. Continued non-compliance may lead to legal action. All incidents must be reported to the CISO within 72 hours. Adherence to Zero Trust and MFA principles is mandatory. See Section 6.

## 4. Incident Response (IT and HR)

### Purpose
The purpose of this section is to develop a proactive incident response plan to minimize damage. Quick responses protect business interests and enhance resilience. A Zero Trust approach is critical during incidents. See Section 6.

### Scope
This policy covers all security incidents and involves all personnel in the response. All users must comply with MFA requirements. See Section 6.

### Directives
A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must be used for logging. This collects and analyzes security data from across the organization. Honeypot systems must be maintained to detect threats. These decoy systems lure attackers, allowing the organization to study their tactics. The Least Privilege principle must be followed during investigations. This limits access to only those who need it to minimize potential damage. An Air Gap must be used for forensic analysis. This isolates affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise. Understanding the Kill Chain model for threat analysis is essential. This framework helps identify stages of an attack and improve defenses. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is vital for effective incident response. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
No exceptions are allowed. All incidents must have a documented response. All users must still follow MFA protocols. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Failure to report incidents will incur a penalty of $1,500 for the first offense. A second offense within one year will escalate to $3,000. Continued failures may result in termination of employment. All incidents must be reported to the security team immediately. Adherence to Zero Trust and MFA principles is mandatory. See Section 6.

## 5. Cloud Storage Security (IT and Finance)

### Purpose
The purpose of this section is to securely store data in the cloud to enhance business agility. Protecting data fosters innovation and competitive advantage. A Zero Trust approach is essential for cloud security. See Section 6.

### Scope
This policy covers all cloud storage solutions used by the company. All users must comply with MFA requirements. See Section 6.

### Directives
All cloud-stored data must be encrypted using AES-256. This ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access. Strict access controls based on roles must be implemented. This assigns permissions according to user roles to limit access to sensitive data. Compliance with relevant laws, including HIPAA, must be ensured. Regular reviews of policies will ensure adherence to legal requirements for data protection. Remember, a Zero Trust approach is vital for securing cloud data. See Section 6.

### Exceptions
Temporary access may be allowed for troubleshooting. However, all exceptions must be documented and reviewed. All users must still follow MFA protocols. See Section 6.

### Enforcement
Non-compliance will incur a penalty of $1,000 for the first violation. A second violation within one year will escalate to $2,500. Continued non-compliance may lead to loss of cloud access. All incidents must be reported to the CISO within 48 hours. Adherence to Zero Trust and MFA principles is mandatory. See Section 6.
